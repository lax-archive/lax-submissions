# lax-submissions

Flagship submissions for the [Lax archive](http://167.233.125.220:8080). 

This README is the working brief for anyone — human or agent — creating the
next submission: it condenses the parts of the Lax spec an author needs, and
then states the style this repository holds itself to. Read the styleguide as
seriously as the rules: these are **flagship submissions**, the examples future
contributors will imitate, and the elegance of the concept packages is the
whole point.

Submission directories currently in this repository:

- `twin-width-treewidth-separation/` — **Lax1**: twin-width can be
  exponential in treewidth (three concepts: treewidth, twin-width, and the
  separation theorem).
- `twin-width-mixed-minor-number/` — **Lax2**: twin-width and mixed minor
  number are functionally equivalent (five concepts: mixed minor number,
  the graph-parameter signature, one theorem-concept per direction, and
  the headline equivalence, concluded by a glue proof assuming the two
  directions). Depends on Lax1. Both ids were deleted from the archive on
  2026-07-29 and hold no record, so this is the one pair whose requires
  cannot be pinned: its two lakefiles still carry the forbidden sibling
  `path` require, and neither submission can be built by `lax` or submitted
  until the ids are allocated and Lax1 is submitted again.
- `monadic-dependence-neighborhood-complexity/` — **Lax5**: monadically
  dependent graph classes have almost linear neighborhood complexity. Its
  seven concepts and three proofs also formalize the weakly sparse
  equivalence between monadic dependence and nowhere denseness. Built on
  the Lax12 draft — its concepts state the theorems over Lax12's graph
  class, nowhere denseness and neighborhood complexity — and depends on
  the Lax14 draft, whose statements its proofs assume.
- `sparsity-lectures/` — **Lax12**: nowhere denseness, uniform
  quasi-wideness, shallow-minor density, the generalized coloring
  numbers, and neighborhood complexity, in the statement forms of the
  Pilipczuk–Siebertz sparsity lecture notes (fifteen concepts; the
  headline weak-coloring theorem is concluded by a glue proof assuming
  the four chain statements, and the almost-linear neighborhood
  complexity of nowhere dense classes assumes it in turn). Depends on
  the Lax14 draft.
- `finite-ramsey/` — **Lax14**: finite Ramsey theorems for pairs and
  tuples — multicolor Ramsey, the two-color clique-or-independent-set
  form (assuming the multicolor statement), and Erdős–Rado tuple Ramsey
  in order-type form.
- `ram-linear-time/` — **Lax11**: algorithmic experiments on a RAM —
  linear-time claims for connected components and
  Courcelle–Makowsky–Rotics model checking on bounded cliquewidth,
  discharged via a verified IMP+ compiler on Lax67's word RAM. Also
  home of the graph encoding, of the parameterized instance format, and
  of a proof of the textbook 2^k bounded search tree for vertex cover.

These submissions are the reference implementations of everything below. When in
doubt, open them and imitate. The normative rule set is the Lax spec
(`lax spec` prints the exact version the installed CLI enforces); when this
document and the spec disagree, the spec wins.

## 1. What the archive is

Lax is the social and archival layer for automated Lean formalization. Its
content comes in two kinds:

- A **concept** pairs a mathematical object stated in natural language (as
  it would appear in a paper) with a faithful Lean encoding. Concepts
  contain **no proofs**: they carry exactly what is needed to pin down the
  semantics of a statement or definition, and nothing more. Reviewers will
  publicly endorse concepts as faithful, staking their names on them —
  concepts are written *for humans*.
- A **proof** is ordinary Lean code discharging a claim made by a concept.
  The kernel checks it, so proofs can be arbitrarily ugly and entirely
  machine-written without compromising trust.

A **submission** is a citable unit containing concepts and proofs. The two
are decoupled: a submission may leave its own proof obligations open, and
may discharge obligations of other submissions. Submissions are frozen in
time — Lean, Lake, and mathlib versions are pinned archive-wide.

The asymmetry drives everything in this guide: **all trust flows through
the concept package, all cleverness belongs in the proof package.**

## 2. Layout and environment

Archive environment (must match exactly):

- toolchain `leanprover/lean4:v4.30.0` (verbatim content of every
  `lean-toolchain`), `specVersion: "1"`
- mathlib pinned to `c5ea00351c28e24afc9f0f84379aa41082b1188f`, required by
  every package
- `autoImplicit = false` everywhere
- background axioms: `propext`, `Classical.choice`, `Quot.sound` — nothing
  else may appear in any axiom set

A submission with id `LaxN` is a folder:

    mysubmission/
      manifest.yaml
      abstract.md              -- non-empty, rendered on the website
      LICENSE                  -- Apache 2.0, verbatim
      concepts/
        lakefile.toml
        lean-toolchain
        LaxN.lean              -- root module: one import line per concept, nothing else
        LaxN/Foo.lean          -- one file per concept, no subfolders
      proofs/
        lakefile.toml
        lean-toolchain
        LaxNProofs.lean        -- root module, same shape
        LaxNProofs/...

`build-output.json`, `lake-manifest.json`, and `.lake/` are generated —
never check them in (the scaffold's `.gitignore` covers them). `lax init`
produces this whole layout; never author `lake-manifest.json` or run
`lake update`.

`manifest.yaml` allows exactly these keys — `specVersion`, `id`,
`leanVersion` (`"v4.30.0"`), `mathlibVersion` (the pin), `title`, `authors`
(list of `name` + optional `orcid`/`github`), `bibEntries` (verbatim BibTeX
strings). See the existing manifests.

Lakefiles are whitelisted: `name`, `defaultTargets`, `[leanOptions]` with
`autoImplicit = false`, `[[require]]` entries, one `[[lean_lib]]`. Package
and lib are both named `LaxN` (concepts) / `LaxNProofs` (proofs). Both
packages require mathlib at the pin. The proof package requires its own
concept package via `path = "../concepts"` — the only `path` require the
spec allows. A dependency on another submission pins the **exact**
repository, commit, and subfolder of that submission's current record — see
`ram-linear-time/concepts/lakefile.toml` for a live example. A sibling
`path` require reaching another submission of this repository is rejected:
rev-pinning every cross-submission edge is what makes a submission's commit
pin its whole source closure. For the local build loop, redirect those pins
back to the folder next door with `.claude/sibling-overrides.sh` (§6).

Namespaces: everything a concept module `LaxN/Foo.lean` declares lives
under `LaxN.Foo`; everything in the proof package under `LaxNProofs`.

Imports: own package, Lean core, mathlib, and required packages only.
Mathlib's dependencies (`Batteries`, `Aesop`, …) are not importable —
import the corresponding mathlib module instead.

## 3. Concepts, statements, proofs — the mechanics

- Every non-root module of the concept package is a **concept**. Its
  **statements** are the `axiom`s it declares. Concepts declare statements
  but never use them: the axiom set of every concept declaration must be
  background-only (plus, for a statement, itself).
- A **proof** is a proof-package `theorem` whose docstring carries yaml
  frontmatter with a `conclusion:` naming a statement it discharges; the
  kernel checks definitional equality of the types. Declarations without
  frontmatter are helpers the archive ignores. Every axiom used anywhere in
  the proof package must be a background axiom or a statement of a
  *directly required* concept package.

### Annotations

A concept is annotated by a single module docstring `/-! … -/`; a proof by
its ordinary docstring `/-- … -/`. Both are markdown with minimal yaml
frontmatter. Text before the first `#` heading is the main description;
`#` headings split off extra sections rendered as separate blocks.

Concept annotation:

    /-!
    ---
    title: Twin-width
    type: definition            -- or: theorem
    ---
    Pure-mathematical description, exactly as a paper would state it.

    # Formalization notes

    Why the encoding is what it is: which fields are derivable and hence
    omitted, why an infimum ranges over a nonempty set, etc.
    -/

Proof annotation:

    /--
    ---
    conclusion: Lax1.ExponentialSeparation.exists_treewidth_le_and_two_pow_lt_twinWidth
    ---
    One-paragraph summary of what is proved.

    # Proof strategy

    The high-level idea, especially how source material is bridged to the
    submitted concepts.

    # Attribution

    Where the proof comes from.
    -/

Unrecognized frontmatter keys are build errors. The `description` (main
text) and `title` are required for concepts. Write prose as **Markdown**:
`*k*`-division, `2^k`, backticks for Lean names. Math that Markdown cannot
carry — subscripts, longer exponents, fractions — goes in KaTeX, `$…$`
inline and `$$…$$` displayed; the renderer typesets it in titles, abstracts
and annotations alike. Raw HTML is escaped, never rendered: no `<sub>`.

## 4. The styleguide: elegance above all

The archive's entire value rests on a reviewer reading a concept and
endorsing it as faithful. A concept package is therefore judged the way a
paper's definitions are judged: by whether a domain expert reads it once
and nods. Elegance is not polish applied at the end — it is the product.

**Concepts read like the paper, not like a formalization.** State the
mathematics the way the literature states it. If the natural definition
talks about partitions, encode partitions — not a state machine that
happens to simulate them. The flagship example: twin-width in
`Lax1/TwinWidth.lean` is a sequence of vertex partitions whose red degrees
are *derived* from homogeneity in the graph. The source development's
trigraph machinery (carrying red/black edge state alongside) is
mathematically equivalent and formally convenient — and lives entirely in
the proof package, bridged by an invariant.

**Plain structures and Prop-valued predicates; no def-encodings.** A
mathematical property is a `Prop`, a mathematical object is a `structure`
whose fields are its defining data and properties. Avoid `Bool`-valued
encodings, decidability plumbing, and `Classical` noise in concept code —
the two flagship concept packages contain zero `Classical` mentions.
Matrix entries in `Lax2/MixedMinorNumber.lean` are `Prop`, so the
graph-to-matrix bridge is literally `G.Adj`.

**Carry nothing derivable.** Every structure field is something a reviewer
must check; fields that follow from the others are review surface wasted.
`Division` has four fields because disjointness and convexity follow from
ordering and covering; `ContractionSequence` has six because partition-hood
of every state follows from "starts at singletons and merges". When you
drop a derivable field, say so in the formalization notes — and prove the
derived facts in the proof package where they are needed.

**Uniform numeric conventions.** A graph parameter is a
`HasXAtMost : … → ℕ → Prop` predicate plus `x := sInf {d | HasXAtMost … d}`
(or `sSup` for a "largest such" parameter). `Nat.sInf ∅ = 0` and bounded
`sSup` handle degenerate cases without special-case hatches — but the
formalization notes must argue why the set is nonempty or bounded, so the
reader knows the convention is never actually exercised.

**Statements over canonical types.** Theorems quantify over concrete,
canonical carriers — `∃ n, ∃ G : SimpleGraph (Fin n), …` — not over
arbitrary types with existentially bundled instances. When two parameters
must share a signature so a theorem can apply to both *directly*, make the
signature an `abbrev` (see `GraphParam` in `Lax2/GraphParameters.lean`): the statement then
mentions `twinWidth` and `mixedMinorNumber` themselves, with no
eta-expanded wrapper lambdas a reviewer would have to unfold.

**One concept per reviewable idea.** A concept is the unit of endorsement.
Lax1 has three: treewidth, twin-width, the separation theorem — each one
sitting a reviewer can hold in their head. Do not pack unrelated
definitions into one module, and do not shred one definition across many.
A definition-concept carries the complete definition of one notion; a
theorem-concept states one result over imported definition-concepts.

**One axiom per concept module — zero for definition-concepts.** The
statement is the unit the archive prices, proves, and lets others assume;
a module with two axioms is two claims wearing one endorsement. The
archive enforces this rule; this repository is its reference
implementation.

**Definitions cannot move later, so place them now.** Concept ids are
permanent dependency targets and definitional identity is nominal — a
later, textually identical copy elsewhere is a *different term*. A def
may stay inside a theorem-concept only when it is the claim-local object
the statement is about (`ccLabels` in Lax11's `ConnectedComponents`
defines the labeling the claim computes). Any notion that could plausibly
appear in a second statement goes in a definition-concept *now*, or every
future statement about it must import a theorem it does not use. When in
doubt, hoist.

**Never `∧` independently provable claims into one axiom.** Each
direction has its own literature proof and deserves its own statement,
bounty, and downstream availability — split into sibling theorem-concepts
and, if the conjunction itself is the headline, add a glue proof
concluding it with the two directions as assumptions (see Lax2). An `∃`
whose body is a conjunction describing one witness (Lax1's separation) is
one claim, not a splittable conjunction.

**Docstring every declaration.** Each `def`, `structure`, field, and
`axiom` in a concept gets a one- or two-sentence docstring saying what it
is mathematically. The module's annotation carries the paper-level prose;
declaration docstrings carry the local reading aid.

**Proofs absorb all the ugliness.** Bridging lemmas, ported source
developments, 800-line inductions — all fine, all invisible to the
endorsement surface. The proof package's job is to connect whatever
material exists (typically a ported development in its own idiom) to the
clean concepts, ideally by proving the submitted notion pointwise *equal*
to the source notion and transporting the source theorem across.

**Abstracts are for mathematicians.** `abstract.md` states what is proved,
in what form, and how the concept surface is organized into review units —
see the existing abstracts for the register.

## 5. Setup

The CLI is the npm package `lax-archive`; everything goes through it.

Prerequisites: Linux or macOS, ~10 GB free disk (mathlib artifacts,
downloaded once), Node.js ≥ 20, git, elan
(`curl -sSf https://elan.lean-lang.org/elan-init.sh | sh`), and a GitHub
account logged in via `gh auth login` (or `LAX_GITHUB_TOKEN` set to a
personal access token).

```sh
npm install -g lax-archive
```

The CLI comes preconfigured for the live deployment: since 0.1.2 the
baked-in defaults are the live server and database (`LAX_SERVER_URL` and
`LAX_DB_URL` still override them if you ever need to).

For an isolated interactive environment, the Docker launcher bind-mounts
this checkout read/write and starts Codex by default:

```sh
.claude/docker-dev.sh             # Codex
.claude/docker-dev.sh claude      # Claude Code instead
.claude/docker-dev.sh bash        # plain shell
```

The image contains Codex, Claude Code, `lax`, and the repository's `uvx`-based
Lean MCP tooling. Its separate persistent home volume holds the container's
own logins, elan toolchain, and warm mathlib store; no host credentials are
mounted. The first launch provisions the project environment and needs
roughly 10 GB, while later launches reuse it.
In Codex's first-run login UI, choose device-code authentication for the
headless container. Run with `--rebuild` to refresh the image and CLIs, or
`--help` for the remaining options.

The archive website is at <http://167.233.125.220:8080>; the database (one
`lax-N` folder per submission, `record.json` + `build-output.json`) is
cloned to `~/.lax/lax-database` by `lax pull-db` — the record's `source` is
the triple every require of it must match. Use it to survey existing
submissions and find prior work to build on. (An older CLI kept a second
clone at `~/.lax/db` with `LaxN` folders; it is not refreshed and not what
`lax build` reads.) The server is a small friends-and-family box
behind plain HTTP — don't hammer it, and expect occasional restarts.

## 6. Workflow

    cd <this repo>
    lax init mysubmission        # allocates LaxN, scaffolds, provisions mathlib
    # ... write concepts and proofs ...
    lax build mysubmission       # full local pipeline; add --replay for the kernel check
    lax serve mysubmission       # preview the submission's website pages
    git add ... && git commit
    git push                     # the server builds from pushed git state
    lax submit mysubmission      # draft: visible on the site, still replaceable
    lax submit mysubmission --register   # registered: immutable, citable, forever

`lax submit` uploads nothing; it sends the (repository, commit, folder)
triple and the server clones, rebuilds, and kernel-replays it — the same
pipeline `lax build --replay` runs locally. Drafts are for iterating;
registration is permanent.

Notes learned the hard way:

- `lake build` inside `concepts/` or `proofs/` works at any time for fast
  iteration (init pre-provisions everything; nothing is downloaded).
- Depending on another submission: the require's `(git, rev, subDir)` must
  match the dependency's **current** record triple exactly. So submit the
  dependency first, pin the exact submitted commit, and run `lax pull-db`
  before building the dependent — a re-draft of the dependency moves the
  triple and breaks downstream pins until they are updated.
- Two submissions of this repository still under joint development would be
  unworkable that way — every edit to the dependency would have to be
  submitted before the dependent could see it. `.claude/sibling-overrides.sh`
  closes the gap: it leaves the pins alone and writes a Lake package
  override redirecting each one to the sibling folder, so `lake build` reads
  the working tree while git keeps the honest commit. Rerun it after
  `lax build` (which regenerates the overrides from the pins, and is the
  build that actually decides whether the pins are right).
- `lax submit` derives the triple from a clean worktree's HEAD. To submit a
  dependency at a pinned historical commit while the branch has moved on,
  submit from a temp clone checked out at that commit.
- Lean warnings do not fail a build; every rule violation is collected and
  reported at once.
- If the server restarts while your submit is building, polling yields a
  404 — just resubmit, nothing is lost.

### Lean 4.30 / pinned-mathlib gotchas

- `tauto` can time out on de-Morgan-shaped iffs after `propext` rewrites;
  `rw [not_and_or, not_and_or]` closes them by `rfl`.
- `rw` with bare commutativity lemmas rewrites the wrong occurrence;
  instantiate explicitly (`(A := …) (B := …)`) or state oriented lemmas.
- `Nat.sSup_empty` does not exist; use `csSup_empty` + `bot_le`.
- The ncard/Finset bridge is `Set.ncard_coe_finset` (lowercase f) at this
  pin.
- Structures with instance fields can break `Finset.univ` synthesis when
  the goal mentions `(someDef D).Node`: prove `∀`-lemmas about `D.Node`
  first, then `exact` into the defeq goal.

## 7. Pre-submit checklist

- [ ] `lax build --replay` passes with no violations
- [ ] every concept: `title` + `type` frontmatter, paper-level description,
      `# Formalization notes` justifying every encoding choice
- [ ] every proof: `conclusion` frontmatter, summary, `# Proof strategy`,
      `# Attribution`
- [ ] concept packages: no `Classical`, no `Bool`-encodings, no derivable
      structure fields, no proofs, docstrings on every declaration
- [ ] statements phrased over canonical types, parameters via
      `HasXAtMost` + `sInf`/`sSup`
- [ ] prose is Markdown, math beyond it in `$…$`, no raw HTML; abstract reads like a
      paper abstract
- [ ] generated files untracked; dependency pins match the current records
