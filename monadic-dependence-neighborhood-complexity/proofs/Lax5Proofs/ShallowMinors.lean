Shallow minors in the idiom of the internal sparsity development: graph
classes over varying finite vertex types, minor models carrying paths,
and nowhere denseness by an excluded-clique bound.  The full
development lives in the `sparsity-lectures` submission; what is kept
here is the vocabulary the polymorphic bridge files
`Lax5Proofs.NowhereDenseBridge` and `Lax5Proofs.Corollary6a` are stated in.

/-- A depth-`d` minor model of `H` in `G`.

For each vertex of `H` we choose a branch set in `G` together with a fixed
center. Every vertex of the branch set is connected to the center by a path of
length at most `d` that stays inside the branch set; distinct branch sets are
disjoint; and every edge of `H` is witnessed by an edge of `G` between the
corresponding branch sets. (Defs 1.10, 2.2-2.4) -/
