Monadically dependent graph classes have almost linear neighborhood
complexity: Theorem 2 of Dreier, Mählmann, McCarty, Pilipczuk and
Toruńczyk.

# Proof strategy

Choose one representative vertex per realized neighborhood trace on
`A`; the representatives leave pairwise distinct traces, so the
semi-induced form of Lemma 21 bounds their number — which is exactly
`traceCount G A` — by c · |A|^(1+ε). The paper's reduction to a
monadically dependent class of twin-free bipartite graphs lives inside
the proof of Lemma 21, whose terminal-sparsification step composes the
two assumed statements of this submission (Corollary 6a and Corollary 6b)
rather than containing their proofs.
