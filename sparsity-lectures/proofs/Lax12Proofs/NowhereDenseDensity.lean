conclusion: Lax12.NowhereDenseDensity.hasSubpolynomialDensity_of_nowhereDense
---
Every nowhere dense graph class has subpolynomial density: for every
depth `r` and every `ε > 0` there is a constant `c` such that every
depth-`r` minor of a member, on `m` vertices, has at most `c * m^(1+ε)`
edges.

# Proof strategy

The internal development proves the threshold form of the theorem — fewer
than `m^(1+ε)` edges once `m` is at least a bound `N` depending on the
depth and on `ε` — for classes indexed by arbitrary finite vertex types.
The submitted class is therefore closed under subgraph copies, whose
internal nowhere denseness follows from the submitted one, and the internal
theorem is instantiated at a submitted member, which lies in that
closure.  A submitted minor model becomes an internal one by bypassing its
walks to paths, and the edge counts are matched by
`Set.ncard_coe_finset`.

Threshold form to constant form: take `c = max 1 (N^2)`.  Above the
threshold the internal bound already gives `< m^(1+ε) ≤ c * m^(1+ε)`; below
it, a graph on `m` vertices has at most `m^2 ≤ N^2 ≤ c` edges while
`m^(1+ε) ≥ 1`; and at `m = 0` both sides vanish.  This is the equivalence
the notes themselves record immediately after the theorem.

# Attribution

The statement is Theorem 3.1 of Chapter 1 of the sparsity lecture notes
of Pilipczuk and Siebertz (numbering of the 2019/20 edition), whose
presented proof is credited there to Zdeněk Dvořák.  The internal
threshold version is
`Lax12Proofs.DensityOfShallowMinors.nd_subpolynomial_density`.
