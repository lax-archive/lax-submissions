conclusion: Lax12.WeakColoringBound.wcol_le_of_scol
---
The weak `r`-coloring number of a graph is at most
`1 + r * (scol_r - 1) ^ r`, where `scol_r` is its strong `r`-coloring
number.

# Proof strategy

The internal development proves the inequality for a fixed linear order.
The submitted parameters are minima over vertex permutations, so it is
enough to run the internal bound under one well-chosen order: take a
permutation witnessing `scol G r` and order the vertices by their
positions under it.  Every vertex strongly reachable in the internal sense
is strongly reachable in the submitted sense — a path is a walk — so the
internal `scol` under that order is at most `scol G r`; and every vertex
weakly reachable in the submitted sense is weakly reachable in the internal
sense — a walk bypasses to a path with a smaller support — so the
submitted `wcol`, being the minimum over permutations, is at most the
internal one.  The right-hand side is monotone in the strong coloring
number, which closes the chain.

# Attribution

The statement is Lemma 2.6 of Chapter 2 of the sparsity lecture notes of
Pilipczuk and Siebertz (numbering of the 2019/20 edition).  The internal
per-order version is `Lax12Proofs.OrderedParameterBounds.wcol_le_of_scol`.
