conclusion: Lax12.AdmissibilityBound.adm_le_of_hasTopologicalDensityAtMost
---
If every depth-`r` topological minor of a graph `G` has at most `d`
times as many edges as vertices, then the `(r+1)`-admissibility of `G` is
at most `1 + 6 * (r+1) * d ^ 3`.

# Proof strategy

The internal development proves exactly this statement, at radius `r + 1`
with its hypothesis at depth `(r + 1) - 1 = r`, so the discharge is pure
idiom translation and no weakening step is needed.

Two translations are involved.  On the hypothesis side, the internal
topological minor model routes each *edge* of the minor along a path,
with a chosen tail and `Sym2` plumbing, while the submitted model carries
a walk for each adjacent *pair*; the repackaging orients an edge by its
chosen tail and reverses the walk for the other orientation.  The
submitted density predicate ranges over minors on the canonical carriers
`Fin m` only, so the arbitrary finite carrier of the internal hypothesis is
transported along `Fintype.equivFin` and the edge counts are matched by
`Set.ncard`-to-`edgeFinset` and by invariance of the edge count under a
graph isomorphism.  On the conclusion side, the internal theorem produces a
linear order; its rank permutation witnesses `HasAdmAtMost`, because a
submitted admissible family of walks bypasses to an internal admissible
family of paths of the same size, and the submitted `adm` — an infimum
over permutations — is then bounded by `Nat.sInf_le`.

# Attribution

The statement is Lemma 3.2 of Chapter 2 of the sparsity lecture notes of
Pilipczuk and Siebertz (numbering of the 2019/20 edition), with the
radius index shifted by one.  The internal per-order version is
`Lax12Proofs.AdmByDensity.adm_le_of_topGrad_bound`.
