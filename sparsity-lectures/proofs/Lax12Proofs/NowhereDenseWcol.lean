Every nowhere dense graph class has subpolynomial weak coloring numbers:
for every radius `r` and every `ε > 0` there is a constant `c` such that
every subgraph `H` of a member, on `m` vertices, satisfies
`wcol_r(H) ≤ c * m^ε`.

# Proof strategy

This is a glue proof: it assumes the four preceding statements of the
submission and does nothing but compose them, so the proof network is
visible on the archive rather than buried inside a single derivation.

Fix `r` and `ε`, and set `ε₁ = ε / (3r² + 1)`.  Subpolynomial density,
applied to the closure of the class under subgraph copies — which is
nowhere dense whenever the class is — gives a constant `c` bounding the
edges of every depth-`r` minor of a subgraph `H` of a member by
`c · k^(1+ε₁)` in its own vertex count `k`.  Since a shallow minor has no
more vertices than its host, `k ≤ m`, so that bound rewrites as the
per-graph density bound `d = ⌈c · m^ε₁⌉` for `H`: `k^(1+ε₁) = k · k^ε₁ ≤
k · m^ε₁`.  A depth-`r` topological minor is in particular a depth-`r`
minor, so `d` bounds the topological density as well, and the
admissibility bound yields `adm_{r+1}(H) ≤ 1 + 6(r+1)d³`; admissibility
is monotone in the radius, so the same bound holds at radius `r`.  The
two coloring-number links then give
`wcol_r(H) ≤ 1 + r·(scol_r(H) - 1)^r ≤ 1 + r·(adm_r(H) - 1)^(r²) ≤
1 + r·(6(r+1)d³)^(r²)` — the arithmetic of Corollary 2.7 of the notes,
which has no concept of its own.

What remains is real arithmetic.  From `d ≤ (c+1)·m^ε₁` and
`ε₁ · 3r² ≤ ε` one gets `d^(3r²) ≤ (c+1)^(3r²) · m^ε`, so
`wcol_r(H) ≤ 1 + K·m^ε ≤ (K+1)·m^ε` with
`K = r·(6(r+1))^(r²)·(c+1)^(3r²)`, using `m^ε ≥ 1`.  The degenerate case
`m = 0` is separate: there `wcol_r(H) = 0` and `m^ε = 0`.

# Attribution

The statement is Theorem 3.4 of Chapter 2 of the sparsity lecture notes
of Pilipczuk and Siebertz (numbering of the 2019/20 edition).  The
composition reproduces that derivation at the level of the submitted
concepts.
