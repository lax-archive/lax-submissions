Every nowhere dense graph class is uniformly quasi-wide: for every radius
`r` there are a threshold function `N` and a separator bound `s` such that
in every member, every vertex set of size at least `N m` contains a
distance-`r` independent subset of size at least `m` after deleting at
most `s` vertices.

# Proof strategy

The internal development proves the statement for classes indexed by
arbitrary finite vertex types.  The submitted class `C` is therefore
closed under subgraph copies — the closure is nowhere dense in the internal
sense as soon as `C` is nowhere dense in the submitted sense, since a
internal minor model of a clique in a copy pushes forward to a submitted
minor model in the host — the internal theorem is applied to the closure,
and the conclusion is specialized back to the members of `C` themselves.
What remains is packaging: the internal statement is phrased with `Finset`
and `card`, the submitted one with `Set` and `Set.ncard`, and the two are
matched by `Set.toFinset` and `Set.ncard_coe_finset`.  Distance
independence and vertex deletion need no translation at all: the internal
step-reduction modules are stated over the definitions of the submitted
concept.

The internal induction alternates an odd and an even distance-reduction
step and consumes Ramsey's theorem twice — directly, to extract a
homogeneous set, and through the bipartite Ramsey lemma (Lemma 3.9 of the
notes) — so both Ramsey statements of the `finite-ramsey` submission are
assumed rather than reproved here.

# Attribution

The statement is Lemma 3.4 of Chapter 4 of the sparsity lecture notes of
Pilipczuk and Siebertz (numbering of the 2019/20 edition), the hard
direction of their Theorem 3.2.  The internal type-polymorphic version is
`Lax12Proofs.QuasiWidenessInduction.nd_implies_uqw`.
