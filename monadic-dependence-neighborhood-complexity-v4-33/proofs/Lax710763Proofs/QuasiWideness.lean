Uniform quasi-wideness in the shape the Adler–Adler argument consumes.
Nothing is proved here: uniform quasi-wideness of a nowhere dense class is
*assumed* from the `sparsity-lectures` submission
(`Lax199508.NowhereDenseUQW.uniformlyQuasiWide_of_nowhereDense`), whose
nowhere-denseness definition is the one this submission's concepts are
stated over as well.  All this file does is convert the `Set`-valued
conclusion to the `Finset` form the caller uses.

/-- Uniform quasi-wideness of a nowhere dense class, specialized to the
submitted members: for every radius `r` there are a threshold function
`N` and a separator bound `s` such that every `A` of size at least
`N m` in a member contains, after deleting a set `S` of at most `s`
vertices, a subset `B` of size at least `m` that is pairwise more than
`r` apart in `G − S`. -/
