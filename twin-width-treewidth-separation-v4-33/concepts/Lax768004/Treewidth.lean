title: Treewidth
type: definition
---
A tree decomposition of a finite simple graph *G* consists of a finite tree
*T* and a bag of graph vertices at each node such that every graph
vertex occurs in a bag, the endpoints of every graph edge occur together in a
bag, and the nodes whose bags contain any fixed vertex induce a connected
subgraph of *T*.

The treewidth of *G* is the least *w* such that *G* has a tree
decomposition with every bag of size at most *w* + 1.

# Formalization notes

A tree decomposition always exists (a single node whose bag is all of the
vertices), so the infimum in `treewidth` ranges over a nonempty set. The
`Fintype` and `DecidableEq` hypotheses of `treewidth` are the uniform
signature shared by all graph parameters in this archive.
