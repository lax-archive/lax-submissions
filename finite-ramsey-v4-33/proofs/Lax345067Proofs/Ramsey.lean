/-!
Ramsey's theorem in its graph form, assembled from the multicolour statement
of this submission.  This module consumes no source material: it colours a
pair by whether it is an edge and reads the two colour classes as a clique and
an independent set.

conclusion: Lax345067.Ramsey.exists_clique_or_indepSet
assumptions:
  - Lax345067.MulticolorRamsey.exists_monochromatic_set
---
Every large enough graph contains a clique on `a` vertices or an independent
set on `b` vertices, derived from the multicolour Ramsey theorem for pairs of
this submission.

# Proof strategy

The graph form is the two-colour case of the multicolour statement, and this
module derives it that way rather than reproving it, so that the archive
records the derivation.

Apply `Lax345067.MulticolorRamsey.exists_monochromatic_set` with two colours and
requested size `max a b`, and colour a pair of vertices by `0` when it is an
edge of the graph and by `1` otherwise.  The colouring is well defined on
unordered pairs because adjacency is symmetric, which is what `Sym2.lift`
requires.  The resulting monochromatic set of size at least `max a b` is a
clique when its colour is `0` and an independent set when its colour is `1`,
since `Set.Pairwise` in either case says exactly that distinct members are
adjacent, respectively non-adjacent; `max` then supplies the requested bound
`a` in the first branch and `b` in the second.

Ramsey, *On a problem of formal logic* (Proc. London Math. Soc. 1930).  The
mathematical content sits in the proof of the multicolour statement
(`Lax345067Proofs.MulticolorRamsey`), ported from the proof package of the
submission *Monadic dependence and neighborhood complexity*; this module is
only the two-colour specialization.
