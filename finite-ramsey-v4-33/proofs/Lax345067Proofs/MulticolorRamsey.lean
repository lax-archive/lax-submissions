/-!
The multicolour Ramsey theorem for pairs, in the submitted form: the ported
list-indexed statement of `Lax345067Proofs.PairRamsey`, specialized to a constant
list of sizes and transported from `Finset`/`Fintype.card` to `Set.ncard` over
the canonical carriers `Fin n`.

conclusion: Lax345067.MulticolorRamsey.exists_monochromatic_set
---
Every colouring of the unordered pairs of a large enough finite set with `k`
colours admits a monochromatic subset of size `s`: the multicolour Ramsey
theorem for pairs, over the canonical carriers `Fin n` and with no hypothesis
on the number of colours.

# Proof strategy

The mathematical content is the ported `Lax345067Proofs.PairRamsey.multicolor_ramsey`,
which asks for a *list* of requested sizes, one per colour, and produces a
`Finset` monochromatic in the colour whose entry it meets.  That statement is
proved by induction on the list of colours from the two-colour graph form
`Lax345067Proofs.PairRamsey.ramsey` (Erdős–Szekeres neighbourhood splitting): the
first colour is turned into a graph, a clique in it is monochromatic of the
first colour, and an independent set carries a colouring by the remaining
colours to which the induction hypothesis applies.

The bridge to the submitted statement instantiates the list as
`List.replicate k s`, so that all colours request the same size `s`, and
transports along `List.length_replicate : (List.replicate k s).length = k`,
precomposing the given colouring with `Fin.cast` in one direction and casting
the returned colour index back in the other.  The carrier is `Fin n`, whose
`Fintype.card` is `n`, and the returned `Finset` is coerced to a `Set`, its
cardinality translated by `Set.ncard_coe_finset`.

The submitted statement carries no positivity hypothesis on the number of
colours, whereas the ported one needs a nonempty list.  The case `k = 0` is
therefore split off first and closed outright: with `N := 1` the carrier
`Fin n` is nonempty, so the assumed colouring produces an element of `Fin 0`,
which is absurd.

# Attribution

The proof is ported from the proof package of the submission
*Monadic dependence and neighborhood complexity* (`Lax5Proofs/Ramsey.lean`),
where it appears as Theorems 3.7 and 3.8 of the source lecture notes.  The
theorem is due to Ramsey, *On a problem of formal logic* (Proc. London Math.
Soc. 1930); the two-colour induction used here is the Erdős–Szekeres argument.
