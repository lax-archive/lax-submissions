Ramsey's theorem for tuples in the submitted form.  The ported development of
`Lax345067Proofs.TupleCore` records order types as `Ordering`-valued functions on
pairs of coordinates; the submitted statement records them as `Prop`-valued
relations.  The bridge below shows that the coarser-looking `Prop`-valued
notion still determines the `Ordering`-valued one, which is all the transport
needs.

conclusion: Lax345067.TupleRamsey.exists_orderType_homogeneous
---
Every colouring of the `ℓ`-tuples over a large enough linearly ordered finite
set with `k` colours admits a subset of size `s` on which the colour of a
tuple depends only on its order type: the finite Ramsey theorem for
hypergraphs of Erdős and Rado, in the order-type form.

# Proof strategy

The mathematical content is the ported `Lax345067Proofs.TupleCore.tupleRamseyAtSize`.
That development first proves Ramsey for *strict-monotone* tuples by the
Erdős–Rado chain-building induction on the arity: for arity `m + 1` one
repeatedly extracts the minimum `v` of the current set, applies the arity-`m`
statement to the colouring `b ↦ c (v ::ᵥ b)` on the rest, and thereby colours
the elements of a long chain by the colour their tuples receive; a pigeonhole
on that colouring of elements produces the homogeneous set.  An arbitrary
tuple is then factored as `a = e ∘ σ` with `σ : Fin ℓ → Fin m` surjective (its
rank pattern, determined by the order type) and `e` strict-monotone, and the
strict-monotone statement is applied once per *shape* `(m, σ)` — a finite type
— shrinking the set each time.  The resulting set is homogeneous for every
shape at once, so the colour of a tuple is read off its shape alone.

Two bridges lead from there to the submitted statement.  The ground set is
taken to be all of `Fin n`, so the ported hypothesis `Nfin ≤ S.card` becomes
`Nfin ≤ n` and the returned `Finset` is coerced to a `Set` with
`Set.ncard_coe_finset`.  And the ported statement concludes with a function
`f` from `Ordering`-valued order types to colours through which the colouring
factors, while the submitted statement says instead that tuples with equal
`Prop`-valued order types get equal colours.  The lemma
`otp_eq_of_orderType_eq` closes that gap in the direction needed: if the
strict-order patterns of two tuples agree then so do their `Ordering`-valued
patterns, because in a linear order `a i = a j` holds exactly when neither
`a i < a j` nor `a j < a i` does.  Both colours are then rewritten through `f`
and coincide.

The submitted statement carries no positivity hypothesis on the number of
colours, whereas the ported one needs one to have a default colour available.
The case `k = 0` is split off first and closed outright: with `N := 1` the
carrier `Fin n` is nonempty, so the assumed colouring applied to the constant
tuple produces an element of `Fin 0`, which is absurd.

# Attribution

The proof is ported from the proof package of the submission
*Monadic dependence and neighborhood complexity*
(`Lax5Proofs/TupleRamsey.lean`).  The theorem is due to Erdős and Rado,
*Combinatorial theorems on classifications of subsets of a given set* (Proc.
London Math. Soc. 1952); the order-type formulation followed here is the one
of Mählmann, *Monadically stable and monadically dependent graph classes*
(PhD thesis, TU Wien 2024), Section 4.
