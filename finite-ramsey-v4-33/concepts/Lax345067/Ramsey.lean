title: Ramsey's theorem
type: theorem
---
For all *a* and *b* there is an *N* such that every graph on at least *N*
vertices contains a clique on *a* vertices or an independent set on *b*
vertices. Equivalently: colouring the edges of a large enough complete
graph with two colours always leaves a monochromatic clique.

# Formalization notes

A clique is a set of pairwise adjacent vertices and an independent set a
set of pairwise non-adjacent vertices, both in mathlib's `Set`-valued,
`Prop`-valued form (`IsIndepSet` is by definition pairwise
non-adjacency, so no complement graph and no decidability appear in the
statement). Sizes are counted with `Set.ncard` and stated as "at least",
as everywhere in this submission.

Graphs range over the canonical carriers `Fin n` for all `n` beyond the
bound, so the statement applies to a graph on any finite vertex set by
transport along a bijection.

This is the two-colour case of the multicolour concept of this
submission — colour a pair by whether it is an edge — and it is proved
that way, by a glue proof assuming that statement. It gets its own
statement because it is the form the literature cites and the form
graph-theoretic applications consume, and because a submission's headline
should not be reachable only through a strengthening.
