title: Graph parameters and functional equivalence
type: definition
---
A *graph parameter* assigns a natural number to every finite simple graph.
Two graph parameters *p* and *q* are *functionally equivalent* when each is
bounded by a numerical function of the other: there are functions
*f*, *g* : ℕ → ℕ such that every finite simple graph *G* satisfies both
*p*(*G*) ≤ *f*(*q*(*G*)) and *q*(*G*) ≤ *g*(*p*(*G*)). Functionally
equivalent parameters are bounded on exactly the same classes of graphs.

# Formalization notes

`GraphParam` is the uniform signature shared by all graph parameters in this
archive: a natural-valued function of finite simple graphs over `Fintype` and
`DecidableEq` instances. It is an abbreviation, so a statement about concrete
parameters mentions them by name — `Lax228581.TwinWidth.twinWidth`,
`Lax153141.MixedMinorNumber.mixedMinorNumber` — with no eta-expanded wrapper
lambdas a reader would have to unfold.

The two directions of `FunctionallyEquivalent` are separate existential
claims rather than one function pair, so each can be established on its own.
