/-- Functional equivalence from the two graph/matrix bridge constructions:

* the left-to-right leaf order of a width-`twinWidth G` twin-decomposition
  makes the ordered adjacency matrix twin-ordered, and
* the symmetric version of the matrix Theorem 10 construction turns every
  mixed-free ordered adjacency matrix into a graph partition sequence.

These are precisely the two graph-facing constructions described around
Theorem 14. -/
