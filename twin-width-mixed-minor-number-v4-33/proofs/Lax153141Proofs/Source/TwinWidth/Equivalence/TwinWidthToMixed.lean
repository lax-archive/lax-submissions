# Twin-width to mixed minor number

This module records the directional bound needed for functional equivalence.
The Section 5 proof of the first twin-width paper provides a linear witness;
with the formal diagonal and mirrored-fusion conventions used for simple graph
adjacency matrices the graph-facing witness is `fun d => 2 * (d + 3) + 2`.

/-- Matrix-level ordered-adjacency form of the twin-width-to-mixed direction.

This is the exact interface supplied by Section 5's first item: for every graph,
there is a vertex order whose adjacency matrix has mixed number bounded by a
function of the graph twin-width.  Since `mixedMinorNumber` is the minimum over
orders, this immediately gives the graph-parameter direction below. -/
