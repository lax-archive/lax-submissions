title: Admissibility
type: definition
---
Fix a linear ordering of the vertices of a graph *G*. An admissible
family of size *k* at a vertex *v* consists of *k* paths of length at
most *r* that start at *v*, end at vertices smaller than *v*, and are
pairwise disjoint apart from *v*. The *r*-admissibility adm_r(*G*) is
the minimum over all orderings of the largest *k* + 1 for which some
vertex of *G* carries an admissible family of size *k*. Counting *v*
itself is the usual convention: it makes admissibility at least 1 and at
most the strong *r*-coloring number.

This is Definition 2.2 of Chapter 2 of the source lecture notes (2019/20
edition), minimized over vertex orderings as in their Definition 2.3;
the notes give the same rationale for the +1, namely consistency with
the reachability sets, which contain the vertex itself.

# Formalization notes

The ordering is a permutation `π` of `Fin n`, as in the coloring-number
concept, and the family is indexed by `Fin k`, so its size is the
parameter of the structure rather than a derived cardinality. Paths are
stated as walks, as everywhere in this submission: bypassing a walk to a
path shrinks its support, so a family of walks meeting only in `v`
yields a family of paths meeting only in `v` of the same size, and the
two readings define the same largest `k`.

The endpoints of a family are automatically pairwise distinct — a shared
endpoint would lie on two paths and differ from `v` — so no injectivity
field is carried. `HasAdmAtMost G r k` says that some ordering admits no
family of `k` paths anywhere, and `adm` is the least such `k`. The set
is nonempty (`k = n + 1` always qualifies, since a family's endpoints
are `k` distinct vertices other than `v`), so `Nat.sInf ∅ = 0` is never
exercised; on the empty graph every bound holds vacuously and `adm`,
`wcol`, `scol` are all `0`.
