title: Nowhere dense classes are uniformly quasi-wide
type: theorem
---
Every nowhere dense graph class is uniformly quasi-wide: for every
radius *r* there are a threshold function *N* and a separator bound *s*
such that in every member, every vertex set of size at least *N*(*m*)
contains a distance-*r* independent subset of size at least *m* after
deleting at most *s* vertices.

This is Lemma 3.4 of Chapter 4 of the source lecture notes (2019/20
edition), the hard direction of their Theorem 3.2, which states that a
graph class is uniformly quasi-wide if and only if it is nowhere dense.

# Formalization notes

Hypothesis and conclusion are the shared predicates of the two imported
definition concepts, so the statement adds nothing of its own. The
strength of the theorem is entirely in the quantifier order already
carried by `UniformlyQuasiWide`: the separator bound depends on the
class and the radius alone, not on the requested size or on the member.
The converse implication holds on subgraph-closed classes but is a
separate claim with a separate proof and is not stated here.
