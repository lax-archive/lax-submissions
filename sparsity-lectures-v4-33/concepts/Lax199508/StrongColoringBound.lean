title: Strong coloring numbers are bounded by admissibility
type: theorem
---
The strong *r*-coloring number of a graph is at most
1 + (adm_r − 1)^*r*, where adm_r is its *r*-admissibility. Together with
the trivial bound adm_r ≤ scol_r this says that admissibility and the
strong coloring number are functionally equivalent parameters.

This is Lemma 2.5 of Chapter 2 of the source lecture notes (2019/20
edition), which state it for a fixed vertex ordering; the two bounds
combine in their Corollary 2.7 to wcol_r ≤ 1 + *r*(adm_r − 1)^(*r*²).

# Formalization notes

Both parameters are the minima over vertex orderings defined in the
imported concepts, and the statement is the minimized form: the
literature proves it for each ordering separately, and the minimized
form follows because the right-hand side is monotone in adm_r, so an
ordering optimal for admissibility witnesses the bound. Natural
subtraction `adm_r − 1` is harmless: admissibility counts the vertex
itself, so it is at least 1 on every nonempty graph, and on the empty
graph both sides degenerate to a true inequality.
