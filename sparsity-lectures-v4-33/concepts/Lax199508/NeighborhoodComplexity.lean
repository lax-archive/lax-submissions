title: Neighborhood complexity
type: definition
---
The neighborhood complexity of a graph *G* on a vertex set *A* counts
the distinct traces of vertex neighborhoods on *A*, that is, the sets
*N(v) ∩ A* for *v* ranging over all vertices of *G*. A graph class has
almost linear neighborhood complexity if for every ε > 0 there is a
constant *c* such that every member *G* and every nonempty vertex subset
*A* leave at most *c* · |A|^(1+ε) traces — neighborhood complexity
|A|^(1+o(1)).

# Formalization notes

The trace count is the natural cardinality (`Set.ncard`) of the set of
traces; on the finite carriers where it is used this is the exact count.
(Over an infinite vertex type with infinitely many traces `ncard` takes
the junk value 0; every use in this submission is on `Fin n`.) Working
with `Set` rather than `Finset` keeps the trace literally `N(v) ∩ A`
and needs no decidability instances.

The bound is stated for nonempty `A` only: the empty set always has
exactly one trace (the empty trace), while `c · 0^(1+ε) = 0`, so the
literal inequality must exclude `A = ∅` — and nothing is lost by doing
so. The exponent is a real power of the cast cardinality, and the
constant `c` is real.

The class-level predicate follows the shape of the other asymptotic
predicates of this submission (`HasSubpolynomialDensity`,
`HasSubpolynomialWcol`): the constant depends on ε alone and the bound
is uniform over the members of the class and over the vertex subsets of
each member.
