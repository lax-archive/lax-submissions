title: Generalized coloring numbers
type: definition
---
Fix a linear ordering of the vertices of a graph *G*. A vertex *u* is
weakly *r*-reachable from *v* if some path from *v* to *u* of length at
most *r* has *u* as its smallest vertex, and strongly *r*-reachable from
*v* if some path from *v* to *u* of length at most *r* has *v* as its
smallest vertex apart from *u* itself. The weak *r*-coloring number
wcol_r(*G*) and the strong *r*-coloring number scol_r(*G*) are the
minima, over all orderings, of the largest number of vertices weakly
respectively strongly *r*-reachable from a single vertex. A graph class
has subpolynomial weak coloring numbers if for every radius *r* and
every ε > 0 there is a constant *c* such that every subgraph *H* of a
member, on *m* vertices, satisfies wcol_r(*H*) ≤ *c* · *m*^ε.

Weak and strong reachability are Definition 2.1, and the two coloring
numbers Definition 2.3, of Chapter 2 of the source lecture notes
(2019/20 edition), which write scol_*r* where the earlier 2017/18
edition writes col_*r*. The subpolynomial bound is the conclusion of
Theorem 3.4 of that chapter.

# Formalization notes

An ordering of the vertices is a permutation `π` of `Fin m` assigning
each vertex its position. Both reachability sets are stated with walks,
as in the nowhere dense concept: shortcutting a walk to a path only
shrinks its support, so walks of length at most `r` reach exactly the
vertices that such paths do. In `wreach` the `π`-minimality of `u` on
the whole support already forces `π u ≤ π v`; in `sreach` only the
interior of the walk is constrained, so `π u ≤ π v` is a separate
conjunct. Both sets contain `v`.

`wcol` and `scol` are the least achievable bounds `k`, `Nat.sInf`s over
nonempty sets — `k = m` works for any ordering — so the convention
`Nat.sInf ∅ = 0` is never exercised; the counts are `Set.ncard`. Weak
and strong coloring numbers are one review unit because they are the
same construction differing in a single clause, and every relation
between them is read off that contrast.

The class-level bound is uniform over subgraph copies (`⊑`) of members,
each measured by its own vertex count `m`; this is the literature form
for subgraph-closed classes, and the uniformity is what localization
arguments downstream consume. At `m = 0` both sides vanish, so no
nonemptiness hypothesis is needed.
