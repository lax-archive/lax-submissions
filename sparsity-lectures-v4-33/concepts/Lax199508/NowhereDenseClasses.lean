title: Nowhere dense graph classes
type: definition
---
A graph *H* is a depth-*r* minor of a graph *G* if *H* can be obtained
from *G* by deleting vertices and edges and contracting pairwise
disjoint connected subgraphs of radius at most *r*. A graph class is
nowhere dense if for every depth *r* there is a *t* such that no member
has the complete graph on *t* vertices as a depth-*r* minor.

The source lecture notes give these as Definitions 2.3 and 2.6 of
Chapter 1 (2019/20 edition), writing *H* ⪯_*r* *G* for the depth-*r*
minor relation. Nowhere denseness is stated there as ω_*r*(*C*) < ∞ for
every *r*, with the excluded-clique form used here spelled out
immediately after as an equivalent.

# Formalization notes

A depth-`r` minor is witnessed by a `ShallowMinorModel`: pairwise
disjoint branch sets, one per vertex of `H`, and an edge of `G` between
the branch sets of any two adjacent vertices of `H`. The radius
condition — every element of a branch set is reached from its center by
a walk of length at most `r` staying inside the branch set — subsumes
connectivity of the branch sets, so no separate connectivity field is
carried. `center_mem` is not derivable: it also rules out empty branch
sets, as the standard definition requires. `⊤ : SimpleGraph (Fin t)` is
mathlib's complete graph.
