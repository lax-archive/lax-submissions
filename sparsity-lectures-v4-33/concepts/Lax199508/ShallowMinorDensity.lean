title: Edge density of shallow minors
type: definition
---
A graph *G* has depth-*r* density at most *d* if every depth-*r* minor
*H* of *G* has at most *d* · |V(H)| edges — the standard "grad" bound on
how dense the shallow minors of a sparse graph can be. A graph class has
subpolynomial density if for every depth *r* and every ε > 0 there is a
constant *c* such that every depth-*r* minor *H* of a member, on *m*
vertices, has at most *c* · *m*^(1+ε) edges: shallow-minor edge counts
*m*^(1+o(1)).

Definition 2.4 of Chapter 1 of the source lecture notes (2019/20
edition) defines the grad ∇_*r*(*G*) as the supremum of |E(H)|/|V(H)|
over the depth-*r* minors *H* of *G*, so the per-graph predicate here
says ∇_*r*(*G*) ≤ *d*.

# Formalization notes

Both predicates are stated over the shallow-minor relation of the
nowhere dense concept, so one notion of depth-*r* minor serves the whole
submission. Minors range over the canonical carriers `Fin m`: every
finite graph is isomorphic to one of those and the shallow-minor
relation is invariant under isomorphism, so nothing is lost.

Edges are counted as the natural cardinality (`Set.ncard`) of
`edgeSet`, which needs no decidability instance and is the exact count
on the finite carriers used here. `HasDensityAtMost` counts edges rather
than twice the edges, matching the usual `|E(H)| ≤ d · |V(H)|` form (the
greatest reduced average density is then at most `2 · d`).

No numeric density parameter is introduced. Every statement of this
submission either supplies a concrete bound `d` or concludes the
class-level predicate, so a `sInf`-defined grad would be review surface
that no claim consumes. The class-level bound carries a multiplicative
constant instead of the size threshold used in the literature proof; the
two agree because a graph on *m* vertices has at most *m*² edges, and
the constant form matches the subpolynomial bound of the coloring-number
concept.
