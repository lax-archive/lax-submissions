title: Uniform quasi-wideness
type: definition
---
A set *A* of vertices is distance-*r* independent in *G* if any two
distinct vertices of *A* are at distance more than *r*. A graph class is
uniformly quasi-wide if for every radius *r* there are a threshold
function *N* and a separator bound *s* such that in every member *G*,
every vertex set *A* of size at least *N*(*m*) contains a distance-*r*
independent subset of size at least *m* of *G* − *S*, for some set *S*
of at most *s* vertices.

This is Definition 3.1 of Chapter 4 of the source lecture notes (2019/20
edition), where the constants *s* are called the margins and the
functions *N* the wideness functions.

# Formalization notes

Distance is stated with walks: two vertices are at distance more than
`r` exactly when every walk between them is longer than `r`, which needs
no metric, connectivity or decidability instance. Deleting a vertex set
is modelled by isolating it — `deleteVerts G S` keeps the carrier and
drops every edge incident to `S` — so every set in the statement lives
in the same vertex type and no subtype plumbing enters the surface.
Since the witness satisfies `B ⊆ A \ S`, the isolated vertices are not
in `B` and distance-`r` independence in the isolated graph is the same
as in the induced subgraph on the complement of `S`.

Sets and `Set.ncard` are used throughout, as in the other concepts of
this submission. The threshold `N` may depend on the requested size `m`,
while the separator bound `s` may not: that uniformity in `s` is the
"uniform" of uniform quasi-wideness and is the whole strength of the
notion. `DistIndependent` and `deleteVerts` are stated for an arbitrary
vertex type, since both are pointwise notions and the proofs consuming
them work over intermediate carriers.
