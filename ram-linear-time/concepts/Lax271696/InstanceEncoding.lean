title: Encoding a graph together with a k-expression
type: definition
---
An algorithm on graphs of bounded cliquewidth is handed a graph
together with a *k*-expression for it, and this is the word that
presents the pair. It has two blocks. The first is the graph itself, in
the compressed sparse row form used everywhere in this submission. The
second is the *k*-expression, as a tree: the number of nodes, then one
number per node giving that node's parent, then one per node giving the
operation performed there, then one per node giving the vertex name it
creates. Children are numbered before their parents and the root is the
last node.

# Formalization notes

The expression block is a certificate, and it is required to be a
correct one: the encoding says that the arrays describe some valid
expression that evaluates to exactly the graph in the first block.
Since the two blocks describe the same graph, a statement is not
weakened by carrying both — the first block is what makes a sentence
`Sat G φ` refer to a graph, and the second is what makes the input
admissible. The arrays determine the expression completely, the vertex
names included, so the existential quantifier over expressions ranges
over at most one thing: the certificate is data in the word, not a
choice made about it.

The vertex-name array is part of the input even though a program
evaluating the expression never reads it. Without it the second block
would not be a *k*-expression, only the shape of one, and a reader
could not check against the first block what the certificate claims.
Its presence costs nothing: it is one number per node, so it only
lengthens the input, and a linear bound is linear in that length.

Children are numbered before their parents, so the root is the last
node. That is what lets a machine evaluate the expression in a single
left-to-right sweep, with no recursion, no stack and no second pass,
and it is where a linear bound comes from. It restricts the *encoding*,
not the class of graphs: every rooted tree admits such a numbering —
any postorder is one — and one can be produced from an arbitrary
numbering by a sort, which this format simply asks the writer of the
input to have done. An encoding that accepted arbitrary parent arrays
would describe the same graphs at the price of a renumbering pass
inside the program.

Cells are read with `List.getD`, which returns `0` outside the word,
exactly as in the compressed sparse row encoding; the length condition
pins the expression block down completely, so the default value is
never reached at a position the other conditions constrain.
