title: k-expressions, and the graphs of cliquewidth at most k
type: definition
---
A *k-expression* builds a graph from single vertices, each created with
one of *k* labels, by three operations: disjoint union of two
expressions; adding every edge between the vertices of one label class
and those of another; and relabelling, which moves one label class into
another. Evaluating an expression gives a vertex set, a graph on it,
and the *k* label classes it has arrived at. A graph has cliquewidth at
most *k* when some *k*-expression evaluates to it — that is the width
measure the theorem below is stated for, and an expression for the
graph is what the theorem takes as input.

An expression is *valid* when its leaves create pairwise distinct
vertices and every edge-adding operation joins two *different* classes;
it is an expression *for* a graph `G` when in addition its leaves
create all of `G`'s vertices and it evaluates to exactly `G`'s edges.

The operations of an expression are also numbered here, since the
numbers are what a machine reading an expression is handed: the
disjoint union is `0`, creating a vertex with label `l` is `1 + l`, and
the two binary operations occupy two further blocks of `k²` numbers
each, in which a pair of labels is read in base `k`.

# Formalization notes

Vertices are named globally, by the leaves: a leaf carries a vertex
name and the vertex set of a subexpression is the set of names of its
leaves. So no node of an expression builds a fresh structure that would
then have to be glued along an isomorphism — every subexpression
evaluates to a subset of the same fixed vertex set, and disjoint union
is literally union. That the two sides of a union really are disjoint
is then a consequence of the leaf names being distinct, which is what
validity requires; it is not built into the definition of the
evaluation, so the evaluation stays a plain structural recursion. What
does change from a node to its parent is the graph, since adding edges
adds them.

The label classes are sets of vertices rather than a colouring
function. That they are pairwise disjoint and cover the vertex set is a
theorem about valid expressions, not a clause of the definition — the
fewer conditions the definition imposes, the less there is to check
against a paper.

Everything computes: vertex sets and label classes are finite sets, the
well-formedness test is a Boolean, and the evaluated graph has a
decidable adjacency relation given by the same recursion, so a
hand-written expression can be evaluated and its edges compared with a
graph by computation rather than by hand.

The requirement that edge addition joins two different classes is part
of validity rather than of the constructor, so that an expression is
plain data with no proof carried inside it. Nothing in the mathematics
needs it; it is there because it is part of the standard definition of
cliquewidth, and leaving it out would silently claim the theorem for a
larger class of graphs than the name denotes. Relabelling tests for the
target class before the source class, so that relabelling a class into
itself is the identity rather than an operation that empties it.
