This submission is a catch-all home for algorithmic experiments in
Lean: running-time claims about concrete algorithms, stated on the
word RAM — the machine of the archive's model submission *The Word
RAM*, which this one requires — and measured by the machine's own step
count. The input encodings are fixed once, and the submission grows by
theorems. Every statement has the same elementary shape — there are a
program and a constant such that, at every word length $w$, on every
admissible input, admissibility including an explicit fitting
inequality against $2^w$, the machine halts within an explicit bound,
having written the answer — and nothing in it is asymptotic: a
linear-time claim is the bound $c(|x|+1)$, a fixed-parameter claim is
the bound $c\,2^k(|x|+1)$, and every uniformity claim — over the
graph, over the parameter, over the word length — is carried by the
order of the quantifiers.

Two theorems are stated. The first is that the connected components
of a graph can be computed in linear time: there are one program and
one constant $c$ such that, given any graph in compressed sparse row
form as a word $x$ of natural numbers, the machine halts within
$c(|x|+1)$ steps having labelled every vertex by the least vertex of
its connected component. The second is Courcelle's theorem in the
Courcelle–Makowsky–Rotics form: for every sentence of monadic
second-order logic and every width bound $k$ there are one program and
one constant $c$ such that, given any graph in compressed sparse row
form followed by a $k$-expression that evaluates to it, the machine
halts within $c(|x|+1)$ steps having written $1$ if the sentence holds
in the graph and $0$ if it does not.

The machine model carries the whole weight of such statements, and it
is deliberately not this submission's: the word RAM and the notion of
computing a function within a time bound are the two concepts of *The
Word RAM*, argued there once for every submission that states running
times. The concept surface here has seven review units. Five
definitions: the compressed sparse row encoding of a graph, in the
dumb form in which an algorithm actually receives it, with nothing
precomputed, no sortedness assumed and repetitions permitted; the
instance format that appends a single parameter entry to that block,
on which the vertex cover ladder of *Vertex Cover Below Two to the k*
is stated; monadic
second-order logic on graphs, with quantification over vertices and
over sets of vertices, its variables counted rather than named so that
satisfaction needs no substitution; $k$-expressions, which build a
graph from labelled single vertices by disjoint union, edge addition
between two label classes, and relabelling; and the instance encoding
that hands a graph together with a $k$-expression for it to the
machine, the numbering of the operations included. Two theorems: the
two statements above.

Both obligations are discharged in the proof package, and the
tower they are discharged through is not this submission's either. The
structured while-language with named scalars and arrays whose
semantics carries the number of statements executed as a cost, the
compiler laying its variables out in the machine's memory, the
simulation theorem bounding the machine's step count by a constant
multiple of that cost with the constant depending on the layout alone,
and the reasoning layer in which an algorithm is verified without
compiled code ever appearing — one rule per construct, and a loop rule
taking an invariant together with a cost potential, so that
termination and the running-time bound are a single obligation and
amortized arguments are direct — all live in the proof package of *The
Word RAM* and are reused here by requiring it, a dependency on proved
theorems that the kernel checks like any others and that adds nothing
to the axioms, which remain the background ones alone. The word RAM
adds one obligation to that discipline: alongside its cost, every
algorithm accounts for the values it holds, so that the same
derivation that yields the running time also shows no intermediate
value outgrows a word — which is where the fitting conditions in the
statements come from, each chosen for what the machine holds rather
than for what a proof would find convenient.

The components algorithm is the textbook sweep of breadth-first
searches, written in that language and verified against a pure model of
the search state, so that the graph reasoning — a set closed under
adjacency contains the whole component of any vertex it contains — is
done on the graph and never on the machine. Its entire cost is one
potential: adjacency slots not yet scanned, queue capacity not yet used,
queue entries not yet expanded, vertices not yet swept. Because the
potential is global the searches are counted together rather than one at
a time, which is what the amortization needs. The constant that comes
out is 840, well above what the compiled program takes per input number
on the small graphs it was tested on. The gap is deliberate, and so is
the slack at every level below: nothing in the tower argues for a tight
constant, and the statement asks only for some constant.

Courcelle's theorem is proved the way it is proved on paper, with the
machine kept out of the mathematics until the mathematics is finished.
That mathematics is an Ehrenfeucht–Fraïssé type algebra: a finite space
of types for each quantifier rank, the type of a subset of an ambient
graph under an assignment of marked vertices and sets, adequacy — equal
types satisfy the same sentences of that rank — and a composition lemma
saying that types are preserved when two regions of one graph are glued
along an overlap that is marked on both sides and crossed by no edge
outside it. That lemma is proved at every rank and across two different
ambient graphs at once, which is what lets the four operations of a
$k$-expression be handled uniformly: disjoint union is the composition
lemma at the empty overlap, and edge addition, relabelling and vertex
creation are three inductions of the same shape. From these the value
table of the fold is extracted by finiteness and choice — nothing
computes it, and the theorem does not ask anything to.

The program is a generic bottom-up fold, verified once against a table
it knows nothing about: it reads a tree given by a parent array whose
children are numbered before their parents, materializes the table into
memory in a prologue, and makes one left-to-right pass in which each
node costs a fixed number of array accesses, independent of the size of
the table — and the row bases of the table are themselves an array, so
that indexing it is two reads and an addition: the compiled driver is
checked, mechanically, to contain no division, no shift, and no
multiplication other than the compiler's address stride — a product
with a fixed layout constant, which is `k − 1` additions — so the
theorem leans on none of the word RAM's stronger instructions. Instantiating the fold with the type table and adding
an epilogue that turns the root's value into $1$ or $0$ gives the
driver. Its constant is a tower in the sentence and the width, because
the table is, and it is never estimated; but the tower is paid once,
before the input is read, and the input-dependent part of the cost is a
fixed number of steps per entry. The $k$-expression is input rather than
something the program computes; the formalization notes on the theorem
say plainly what that leaves open, as they do for everything else the
statement decides rather than proves.

One more theorem is proved here without being stated here. The proof
package contains the textbook bounded search tree of Downey and
Fellows — vertex cover decided within $c\,2^k(|x|+1)$ steps, written in
the same while-language and costed by the same loop rule, with the
constant 9000 — but its statement is the base rung of the vertex cover
ladder and lives on the surface of *Vertex Cover Below Two to the k*,
the submission that lowers the base of the exponential twice and
carries all three rungs together. That submission requires this proof
package and discharges its base rung with the theorem proved here; what
remains on this surface is the instance format the whole ladder is
stated on, the graph block with the parameter appended.
