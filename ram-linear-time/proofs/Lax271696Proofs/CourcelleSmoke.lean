Sanity check for the Courcelle surface: the two definitions the axiom of
`concepts/Lax271696/Courcelle.lean` is stated over — satisfaction from
`concepts/Lax271696/Mso.lean` and the instance encoding from
`concepts/Lax271696/InstanceEncoding.lean` — are exercised on concrete
objects, so that neither is vacuous and the index arithmetic of the
instance word is known to line up.

Two things are checked. First, satisfaction: the sentence "there are two
adjacent vertices" holds in the two-vertex complete graph and fails in
the two-vertex empty graph, computed from the surface `Sat` alone.
Second, the instance encoding: a literal word is exhibited as an
encoding of the path `0—1—2` together with the `2`-expression for it
from `CliqueExpr.lean`. The word is the compressed sparse row block of
the path followed by the expression block — the number of nodes, the
seven parents, the seven operation codes, the seven vertex names — and
`EncodesModelCheckingInstance` is proved for it, expression and all.

Nothing here is a proof of a submitted statement; this is a smoke test
of the concept surface, in the style of `EncodingSanity.lean`.
