/-!
The graph-theoretic facts the search proof consumes, and nothing else.

Two groups. The first is about the labelling: it is the least vertex of
the component, so it is at most the vertex itself, it is *attained* —
the least vertex is reachable, which is why an unlabelled vertex in the
sweep is the root of its own component — and it is constant on
components. The second is about the encoding read as arrays of numbers:
the offsets are nondecreasing all the way up, so every block lies
inside the target array, and adjacency is membership in a block.

Everything here is stated for numbers rather than for `Fin n`, because
that is what an array index is. `lbl G w` is the label of the vertex
numbered `w`, and `n` — not a vertex — where `w` is out of range, which
is the same marker the program uses for "unvisited".

/-! ### How much of the target array a set of blocks takes up

The cost of the search is paid out of the length of the target array,
so the proof needs to know that the blocks of distinct vertices do not
overlap. They do not, because the offsets are nondecreasing: the blocks
tile the array. -/
