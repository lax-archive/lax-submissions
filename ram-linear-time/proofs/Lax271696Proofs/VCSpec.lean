/-!
The pure side of the bounded search tree, with no environment anywhere.

Three layers. First the search predicate `Ok M b` — some vertex cover
extends `M` by at most `b` vertices — with the three facts the search
lives on: the bridge to the concept's `vertexCoverNum`, the branch
lemma (an uncovered edge forces one of its endpoints, at one unit of
budget), and cover-on-exhaustion (a marking no CSR slot escapes is a
cover). Second the configuration of the search: a stack of frames, a
mode, a budget and an answer, with the invariant `Inv` tying the
machine's state to `Ok ∅ k` and one preservation lemma per transition.
Third the potential: the pending work `pot` of a configuration, which
every transition strictly decreases; this is the amortized budget the
loop rule spends.

The stack is a list with the *top at the head*, and both the stored
alternative `Alt` and the potential `stackPot` recurse on it carrying
the current budget: the frame below the top was pushed at one budget
more, so the recursion adds one as it descends. This is what makes
push, flip and pop line up definitionally — no index arithmetic over
frame positions ever appears.

The budget of a level is `fPot b = 4·2^b − 3`, so that
`fPot (b+1) = 2·fPot b + 3` exactly: a push splits its level's budget
into the active child, the stored child and three units of slack, one
of which pays for the push itself. The naive `4·2^b` fails — a push
would gain a unit — so the `−3` is load-bearing; do not simplify it
away.
