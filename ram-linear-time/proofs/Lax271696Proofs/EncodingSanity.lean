/-!
Sanity check for the graph encoding: a concrete word is exhibited as
the encoding of a concrete graph, so that `EncodesGraph` is known to be
satisfiable and the index arithmetic of the header, the offsets and the
target array is known to line up.

Nothing here is a proof of a submitted statement; this is a smoke test
of the concept surface.
