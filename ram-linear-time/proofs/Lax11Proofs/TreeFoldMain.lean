/-!
The tree fold, end to end.

The phases are proved; what is left is to run them in a row, hand each
one the frame conditions of the ones before, and cash the result in at
the machine. The result is the schema's theorem: for every table there
is a machine program that reads a parent-pointer tree and writes the
fold of that table over it, in time linear in the length of the word, at
every word length that admits the word and the table.

Three things about the constants deserve saying out loud, because the
schema will be instantiated with a table nobody wants to look at.

*The table is paid for once, and it is a constant.* Materializing it
costs three units per entry, so `3 * (L + V + V²)` before the tree is
even seeded. That is not linear in the input — it does not depend on
the input at all — and it is legitimate exactly because of the order of
the quantifiers: the table comes first, the program is generated from
it, and only then is the tree given. A bound of the form
`c * (|x| + 1)` with `c` chosen after the table is what the statement
asks for, and `c` is allowed to be as monstrous as the table is.

*The per-node cost is a constant number of array operations*, and it is
the same constant whatever the table says: seeding is two reads and a
store, pushing is a parent read, two accumulator reads, two table reads
and a store. Nothing in the loops scales with `V` or `L`. This is the
property the eventual instantiation needs — the type table may have a
tower of types in it, and the fold over the decomposition still takes
`O(N)` steps with the tower living entirely in the constant.

*The word length, though, does see the table.* A label indexes the seed
array and a cell of the square table is indexed by two values at once,
so `L` and `V²` are numbers the machine holds; a machine whose words
cannot number the table's entries cannot run the table. That is what
`Table.Fits` says, and the same constant that pays for materializing the
table pays for holding its indices, so the statement carries one
constant and not two.

The three arrays holding the tree have one entry per node; the three
