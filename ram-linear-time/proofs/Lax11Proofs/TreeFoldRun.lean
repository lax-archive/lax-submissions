/-!
The tree fold, run: what the schema's three phases do to an environment,
what they cost, and under which bound they stay.

The mathematics is already finished in `TreeFold.lean` — `sweep_eq_val`
says the one forward pass computes the tree fold — so nothing here is
about trees. Every lemma below has the same shape as the phase lemmas of
the connected-components driver: the array is `arrOf` of a named
function, the loop moves that function, the frame conditions say what
was not touched, and `Run.while_count` pays for the loop. Uniform cost
suffices at every loop, so the global potential the driver needed does
not appear: a node is visited once, a table entry is stored once.

The value bound costs the phases one hypothesis each and no invariant
clause. Everything the fold produces is a value of the table, a label, a
cell index of the square table, or a counter below the number of nodes,
so `Table.Fits` together with "the number of nodes is below the bound"
is all three of them ask for. That the table's *size* rather than its
content is what the machine has to hold is the whole content of the
bound here: the alphabet may be a tower high, and then the word has to
be wide enough to number it.

The one place where something has to be checked rather than copied is
the combination lookup. `tab` is a square table read at `a * V + b`, and
the machine has no multiplication, so the row bases live in a second
array `row`. The lookup is in range, and lands on the entry it should,
exactly because both accumulators are below `V` — which is `sweep_lt`,
and which is why the push loop's invariant is stated with `sweep` rather
than with an anonymous function.

/-! ### The largest entry of a word

A program on a word RAM has to hold every entry of its input, whatever
the encoding says about it, and an encoding does not always say
everything: the tree format leaves the root's parent entry free, and the
instance format of Courcelle's theorem leaves the vertex names at inner
nodes free too. So the bound these programs run under mentions the
largest entry of the word, and the fitting condition of a statement
about them is what supplies it. -/

/-! ### The sweep

The one pass. Node `i` is finished when the loop reaches it — all of its
children are earlier — so it is pushed into its parent, which is later
and therefore still open. -/

/-- The invariant of `pushLoop`: the accumulator array *is* the pure
sweep after `i` pushes. There is nothing weaker to say — the array holds
partial folds at every node at once, and that is exactly what `sweep`
was defined to be. -/

/-- The sweep, at `22` per node: every node holds its value afterwards.
This is the schema's theorem — `sweep_eq_val` turns the invariant into
the tree fold — and the cost is one visit per node, with no search for
children anywhere. The largest number the pass produces is the cell of
the square table it looks the combination up in, which is where
`Table.Fits` is needed and where a table too large for the word length
would show. -/
