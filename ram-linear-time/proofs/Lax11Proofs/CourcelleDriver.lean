/-!
The driver of Courcelle's theorem: the program, and the two bridges
from the instance word to the fold.

Everything the program does has been proved somewhere else. The fold
schema of `TreeFold.lean` reads a parent-pointer tree and computes a
table's fold over it; `MsoTable.lean` supplies the table, and its
`acceptVal_val` says the root value decides the sentence. What is left,
and what this file is, is the *instance word*: the surface encoding of
`Lax11.InstanceEncoding` presents a compressed sparse row block followed by an
expression block of three arrays, and the schema's own encoding is
neither of those. So the program here is the schema's program with a
different front end and a one-instruction epilogue.

Three things are worth saying about it.

*The program never looks at the graph.* It reads the compressed sparse
row block only to get past it — two header entries, then `n + 1 + 2m`
numbers dropped into an array that is never read again — and the
expression block's vertex-name array likewise. That is not an
optimization, it is the content of the theorem: the graph is determined
by the expression, so the certificate is all the program needs, and the
first block is there for the *statement*, to say which graph the
sentence is about. The two junk arrays are the honest way to write "read
and discard" in a language whose only input construct is a read.

*The accept bit is a table lookup, not a decision.* The root's value is
a number naming a type, and whether that type is accepting is a fact
about the mathematics, not something the program could compute. So the
accepting set is materialized as one more array — `arrOf T.V` of a
noncomputable function, exactly like the three tables of the schema —
and the epilogue is a single `write` of `acp[acc[N-1]]`. Plan decision
C9, at three lines of program text.

*The program is generic in the table.* `driverCom` takes the table and
the accepting-set array as data, so it can be instantiated with a
computable stand-in and run. It is: the smoke test at the end runs the
compiled machine on the literal instance word of `CourcelleSmoke.lean`
against a hand table that decides whether the graph has an edge. The
real table is noncomputable and can never be run, which is exactly why
the plumbing has to be tested against one that can.

The schema's phases, with the two blocks of the instance word in front
and the accept lookup behind. -/

/-- The driver, for a given table and a given accepting-set array.
The first four phases consume the compressed sparse row block: its two
header entries give its length, and the rest goes into `csr`, which
nothing ever reads. The expression block is then read as the schema
wants it — one number for the node count, then the parents and the op
codes — followed by the vertex names, which go into `ids` and are, for
the same reason, never read again. -/

/-! ### The first bridge: the surface relation forgets to the fold's

`Lax11.InstanceEncoding.EncodesExpr` and `MsoTable.EncExpr` are the same
recursion, except that the surface one also pins the vertex name at
every leaf — the certificate clause the program has no use for. The
forgetful direction is a structural induction with nothing in it; the
two `children` are syntactically the same definition, so they need not
even be rewritten. -/

/-- The schema's children and the surface's are the same list. -/

    Lax11.InstanceEncoding.children par i = TreeFold.children par i := rfl

/-! ### The second bridge: the instance word, as the program reads it

The program's view of the word is a list of segments: two header
numbers, the rest of the graph block, the node count, and then three
arrays of `N` numbers each. `EncodesModelCheckingInstance` states its clauses through
the accessors `parent`, `opCode`, `vertexName`, which are `List.getD` at
computed offsets; this lemma turns the whole package into the segments
and the two functions the fold speaks about. -/

/-- **The instance word, decomposed.** Everything the driver's run needs
about an admissible input: the four segments the reads consume, their
lengths, the two functions the fold folds over, and the expression that
the second block encodes. -/

/-! ### The program, run on a table that can be run

The house discipline is to `#eval` the compiled machine against the
model before proving anything about it. The table of the theorem is
noncomputable — it is extracted by choice from the congruences of
`MsoCliqueOps.lean` — so what is run here is a stand-in of exactly the
same shape: a table over the *same* operation alphabet, decoded with the
*same* `Op.decode`, whose values are the three bits "class `0` is
nonempty", "class `1` is nonempty", "the graph has an edge", together
with the partial states the schema's sequential fold needs. That is a
genuine clique-width dynamic program: `η i j` with `i ≠ j` creates an
edge exactly when both classes are nonempty, and `⊕` and `ρ` are the
obvious things.

So the two sentences the run decides are "some two vertices are
adjacent" and its negation, and the instance is the literal word of
`CourcelleSmoke.lean` — the path `0—1—2` in compressed sparse row form
followed by the `2`-expression `pathExpr`. The path has an edge, so the
machine must write `1` for the first and `0` for the second, and it must
get there having skipped a graph block and a vertex-name array it never
reads. -/

/-! ### No data-dependent wide operation in the compiled program

The fold indexes a square table, which is where a multiplication would
naturally appear, and a linear-time claim on a unit-cost machine that
leans on unit-cost multiplication is at risk of being an artifact of the
model. The row bases are materialized instead, so the algorithm is
addition, subtraction and control only.

What survives of that in the program text is exactly one multiplication
per array access, and it is not the algorithm's: `Layout.idxCode`
multiplies the index by the *number of arrays* — a compile-time
constant, the stride of the interleaved array block — which is `k − 1`
additions for a fixed layout, independent of the input and of the word
length. So the check below is that there is no division and no shift at
all, and that every `mul` in the program is such a stride
multiplication: the instruction directly after the `set` that puts
`layout.arrays.length` into its scratch cell, which is the only shape
the compiler emits. Nothing the machine multiplies depends on the
table, and nothing depends on the instance.

That is a property of the program text, and the program text is the same
for every table — only the lengths of the four store prologues depend on
it — so it is checked here by evaluation rather than asserted in an
annotation. -/

/-- The program has no division and no shift, and its only
multiplications are the address strides of `Layout.idxCode`: a `mul`
whose scratch operand was just `set` to `L.arrays.length`. A `mul` in
any other position — in particular at the very start of the program,
where nothing precedes it — is rejected. -/
