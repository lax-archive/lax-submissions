/-!
The three straight phases of the driver: reading the input word into an
array, clearing the label array, and writing the labels out. They are
proved here, away from the search, because they say nothing about graphs
— a read loop copies a prefix of the tape into an array whatever the
numbers mean — and because together they fix the shape every phase lemma
of this development has: what the phase does to *its* array, what it
costs, and under which bound it stays.

All three *are* the same loop, `i := 0; while i < m do …`, and none of
them owns it. `Spec.forRangeZero` is that loop — the counter, the cost,
and the reading of the failed condition — and `Lib.Fill` is what two of
the three then do to their array, one cell per turn; `initLab` is a
single application of `Fill.loop_spec` and has no proof of its own at
all. What is left of a phase is its body, and `run_vcg` walks all three
of those, tape operations included.

What a phase leaves alone is not stated: which names a command may touch
is syntactic, and `Lax67Proofs.Frame` decides it, so a caller recovers a
frame condition from the run the conclusion already carries at the price
of one `by decide`. `readLoop`'s input tape is the exception — it is
consumed, so what is left of it is a conclusion. And the value bound `B`
costs each phase one hypothesis and no invariant clause: all it produces
is a counter inside its array, a number just read, or one already there.

/-! ### Reading a block of the tape into an array -/

/-- What `readLoop` may store into, and what it may assign to. Its limit
`lim` is not among the latter, which is why the caller may pass a scalar
it wants to keep; a frame obligation is then `by decide` for a literal
name and `by simp [h]` for a bound one. -/

tape into the array, and what is left of the tape starts at `i`. Its

/-- Reading `k` numbers off the tape into the array `a`, at a cost of
`12` per number. The array must already have length `k`; the numbers
read are the first `k` of the tape. The loop counts up to `k` and moves
numbers it has just read, so it stays below the bound as soon as the
count and those numbers do. -/
