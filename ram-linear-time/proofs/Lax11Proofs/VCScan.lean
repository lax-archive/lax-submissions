/-!
The scan lemma: one pass over the target array either finds an
uncovered edge or certifies that the marking touches every slot.

The loop is flat — each turn advances either the slot pointer `j` or
the block owner `u` — so its cost is not constant per slot and the
potential form of the loop rule is what bounds it: `50·(2m − j) +
50·(n − u)` pays for both kinds of turn at once, the same amortization
the components driver used for its search.

The conclusion is a dichotomy on the flag. Found means *an* uncovered
adjacent pair, not the least one — the invariant downstream never asks
which. Not found means every slot of every block has a marked endpoint,
which is exactly what `isVertexCover_of_slots` consumes. The owner is
correct because offsets are nondecreasing, so a slot has a unique
owner; that uniqueness is the only graph fact the loop itself needs.

The value bound costs the scan four hypotheses and no invariant
clause: everything it produces is a vertex number, a slot number, an
offset or a mark, and the caller's bounds on those are all the bounded
semantics asks for.
