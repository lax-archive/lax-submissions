Composition: gluing two regions along their marked overlap.

This is the make-or-break theorem of the type algebra. Stated as a
*congruence*, like everything else here: no
function on types is constructed, and no structure is ever glued. Two
regions `X`, `Y` of one ambient graph, overlapping only in marked
vertices and with no edges between their private parts, have a union
whose `q`-type is determined by the two `q`-types — *across ambients*,
so the same two types occurring in a different graph give the same type
of the union there. That is exactly the statement the tree fold needs:
it is what says a table entry exists at all.

The marks are handled with a **shared pool**. The union's marks are one
tuple `m : Fin c → Fin n`, and the two sides read their own marks off it
through index maps `σ : Fin a → Fin c` and `τ : Fin b → Fin c`; the
hypotheses `Glue` collects (marks lie in their region, the pool is
covered by the two sides, the overlap is marked on both sides, no edges
between the private parts) are then all statements about the pool. The
concatenated-marks form is the instance
`c = a + b, σ = Fin.castAdd, τ = Fin.natAdd` — `typ_append_congr` at the
end of the file, five lines. The pool form is the one to prove, for two
reasons: the vertex-move step extends the pool by `Fin.snoc` and both
sides' index maps then re-index by lemmas that already exist
(`snoc_comp_liftLast`, `Fin.snoc_comp_castSucc`), so the induction
contains *no* mark bookkeeping at all; and the sequential fold of the driver
grows one pool as it absorbs children, which is the pool form applied
repeatedly rather than an `Fin.append`-associativity argument each time.

Where the content actually sits:

* the atomic layer (`atomic_union_congr`), and inside it the cross pair
  `adj_of_cross` — an edge from `X` to `Y` has an endpoint in the
  overlap, hence is *recorded in one of the two diagrams*, and the
  overlap pattern moves it to the other ambient. This is the only place
  the no-edges hypothesis is used, and it is used at every rank, since
  the diagram is a component of every type;
* the vertex move, where the new mark's overlap pattern has to be
  re-established (`v` is a mark of the other side iff its counterpart
  `w` is) — the diagram of the transferred type does it;
* the set move, where `S` splits as `(S ∩ X, S ∩ Y)`; the two witnesses
  produced on the other side agree on the overlap because the overlap
  is marked and the diagram records the memberships of marks. Their
  union is the witness, and `typ_congr_inter` throws away the parts
  outside each region.

One general fact about `typ` is proved on the way, because the vertex
move needs the *other* side's hypothesis one rank down:
`typ_succ_congr`, the type of rank `q+1` determines the type of rank `q`.

read off the shared pool `m` by `σ` and `τ` — lie in their own region,
every pool position is a mark of one of the sides, every vertex of the
overlap is marked on both sides, and no edge of `G` joins `X ∖ Y` to
`Y ∖ X`. -/

transfers to the other ambient graph. It cannot be read off either
diagram directly — the two marks are on different sides — but by the
no-edges hypothesis one of its endpoints lies in the overlap, and is
therefore *also* a mark of the other side, where the diagram does record
the edge; the overlap pattern then identifies the two mark positions in
the second ambient as well. -/

/-! ### Extending the pool

The two bookkeeping lemmas of the vertex move. Marking one more vertex
`v ∈ X` appends `v` to the pool; `X`'s index map becomes `liftLast σ`
and `Y`'s becomes `Fin.castSucc ∘ τ`, so that both sides' mark tuples
come out as `Fin.snoc (m ∘ σ) v` and `m ∘ τ` — no re-indexing lemma is
needed beyond the two below and `snoc_comp_liftLast` from the mark
lemmas. The gluing hypotheses survive verbatim; the *overlap pattern*
does not, and `pat_snoc` is where it is re-established. -/

/-! ### Composition -/

/-- **Composition, the cross-ambient congruence.**
Two regions of one graph that overlap only in marked vertices and have
no edges between their private parts have a union whose `q`-type is
determined by their two `q`-types and the overlap pattern — and the
determination does not depend on the ambient graph, so two regions of
*another* graph with the same pair of types have a union of the same
type. This is the theorem that lets a tree decomposition be folded: the
table entry for a pair of types exists because the union's type does not
depend on which structures realized them.

The induction is on the rank, with `c`, `a`, `b` and `s` moving. A
vertex move on the union is a vertex move of one side (with the other
side's hypothesis dropped a rank by `typ_succ_congr`); a set move
`S ⊆ X ∪ Y` is the pair of moves `S ∩ X` and `S ∩ Y`, and the two
witnesses obtained on the other side are glued back by their union,
which is legitimate because they agree on the overlap. -/

tuples and the union's marks are their concatenation. It is the pool
form at `c = a + b`, `σ = Fin.castAdd`, `τ = Fin.natAdd`, and it is a
rewrite away. -/
