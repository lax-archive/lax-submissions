Monadic second-order logic on graphs: the syntax, and the semantics that
is the new trust object.

`MSO`, `rank` and `Sat` **live on the endorsement surface**, in
`concepts/Lax11/Mso.lean`, and are re-exported here under the names the
development already uses: seven constructors and a fifteen-line
recursion, and nothing else. Everything that a formalization of MSO
usually drags along — substitution, capture avoidance, a `Closed`
predicate, well-formedness side conditions — is absent by construction.
What this file adds is the machinery the proofs need and the surface
does not carry: the `rank` equations, the relativized `SatIn`, and the
bridge between them.

*Well-scoped de Bruijn.* `MSO r s` is the type of
formulas with `r` free vertex variables and `s` free set variables, so
`Sat` is total over a pair of environments `Fin r → Fin n` and
`Fin s → Set (Fin n)`: there is no partial valuation, no default value,
and no junk to audit. The indices are the same `r` and `s` that index the
type algebra's `T q r s`, which is what makes the adequacy induction line
up argument for argument. The one price is that de Bruijn indices are not
textbook notation; the honest alternative — named variables — needs
capture-avoiding substitution *in the trusted surface*, which is a far
worse object to audit than an index.

Two conventions worth stating, because a reader checking the semantics
against a paper will want them.

*Variables are levels, not indices.* A quantifier extends the environment
with `Fin.snoc`, i.e. at the *last* position, so the outermost bound
variable of a formula is `0` and the innermost is `Fin.last`. This is the
convention `typ` already uses for its moves (`MsoTypes`), and it is why
adequacy needs no shifting anywhere.

*Only `¬`, `∧` and `∃` are constructors.* Disjunction, implication and
universal quantification are abbreviations at the point of use, not
syntax: every one of them would add a case to the trusted recursion and
a case to every induction, and buy nothing that `not`/`and` does not
already give. `MSO₁` is the whole scope: quantification
over vertices and vertex sets, with adjacency, equality and membership as
the atoms.

Finally, `SatIn` — satisfaction *relativized to a region* — is the
workhorse the type algebra actually talks about; `Sat` is the special case
of the whole graph (`satIn_univ`). The surface carries `Sat` alone.

/-! ### Syntax

The syntax, the quantifier rank and satisfaction are the surface
definitions of `Lax11.Mso`; the constructors are re-exported too, so
that every use site below reads as if they were declared here. -/

/-! ### Semantics

The trust object, `Sat G m A φ` — that `φ` holds in the graph `G` under
the vertex environment `m` and the set environment `A` — is on the
surface. What is defined here is its relativization to a region, which
is what the type algebra computes. -/

variable {n : ℕ}

/-- Satisfaction relativized to a region `X`: the atoms are read in the
ambient graph `G`, but both quantifiers range over `X` only — vertices
in `X`, sets contained in `X`. This is the notion the type algebra
computes (`typ` moves over exactly these), and it is the whole graph's
satisfaction when `X` is everything (`satIn_univ`). -/

/-! ### Smoke tests

Two hand-checked sentences on the two-vertex complete graph, to catch a
semantics that type-checks and means something else. `∃x∃y adj x y` holds
there; `∃X ∀x (x ∈ X)`, spelled with the available constructors as
`∃X ¬∃x ¬(x ∈ X)`, holds in any graph, witnessed by `univ`. -/

/-- The two-vertex complete graph has an edge. -/
example : Sat (⊤ : SimpleGraph (Fin 2)) Fin.elim0 Fin.elim0
    (MSO.exV (MSO.exV (MSO.adj 0 1))) := by
  refine ⟨0, 1, ?_⟩
  show (⊤ : SimpleGraph (Fin 2)).Adj _ _
  simp only [SimpleGraph.top_adj]
  decide

/-- The empty graph on two vertices has none. -/
example : Sat (⊥ : SimpleGraph (Fin 2)) Fin.elim0 Fin.elim0
    (MSO.not (MSO.exV (MSO.exV (MSO.adj 0 1)))) := by
  rintro ⟨u, v, h⟩
  exact h

/-- Some set contains every vertex. -/
example : Sat (⊤ : SimpleGraph (Fin 2)) Fin.elim0 Fin.elim0
    (MSO.exS (MSO.not (MSO.exV (MSO.not (MSO.mem 0 0))))) := by

  rintro ⟨v, h⟩
  exact h (Set.mem_univ _)

/-- The rank of that last sentence is `2`: the negations are free. -/
