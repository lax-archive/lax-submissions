The driver: connected components, as an IMP+ program.

The algorithm is the textbook one. Sweep the vertices in increasing
order; when a vertex is still unlabelled it is the least vertex of its
component, so start a breadth-first search from it and label everything
the search reaches with that vertex. The label array doubles as the
visited array, with `n` — not a vertex — as the marker for "unvisited",
so no second array is needed.

Two details are chosen for the sake of the cost proof rather than the
algorithm — the queue is never reset between searches, and a scalar
counts the adjacency slots already scanned — and neither of them costs
the algorithm anything. The argument that they are free belongs where a
reader of the submission will look for it, so it is in the annotation of
`CCMain.exists_linearTime_program_ccLabels` rather than here.

The cost argument, for the record, is a single potential
`c₁·(2m − scanned) + c₀·(n − tail) + c₀·(tail − head) + c₂·(n − u)`,
where `scanned` is the number of adjacency slots already looked at. One
turn of the search loop dequeues a vertex, scans its block and enqueues
some vertices: the first term pays for the scan, the second for the
enqueues, and the third gives back the one unit the dequeue itself
cost. The potential is global, so the amortization crosses the boundary
between the searches — which is exactly what a per-loop constant cannot
express, and why the while rule takes a potential.

/-- Look at the adjacency slot `j`: if the vertex it names is
unvisited, label it and put it on the queue. `sc` counts the slots
looked at; it exists only so that the cost potential is a function of
the scalars, and it costs one unit per slot. -/

/-! ### The program, run

The compiler was checked by evaluation before anything was proved, and
evaluation caught two compiler errors that no proof had yet been asked
to find. `runOut` runs the machine to a
halt and reports the output tape and the number of steps; the graphs
below are given in the concept's encoding, and the outputs are the
least-vertex labels. The word length is fixed at sixteen, which is more
than these graphs need; the step counts do not depend on it. -/

steps, reporting the output tape and the number of steps taken. -/

      | none => some (s.out, k)

every number these graphs produce. -/
