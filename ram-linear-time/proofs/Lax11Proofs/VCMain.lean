The bounded search tree, run whole. The statement this file proves is
no longer a concept of this submission: it is the base rung of the
vertex cover ladder, *Vertex Cover Below Two to the k*, which requires
this theorem and cashes it in at its own surface.

The read phase is the components driver's, one `read` longer; the
search is the loop of `VCLoop`; what is left is the arithmetic. One
index computation is four instructions whatever the number of arrays,
so the machine pays ten steps per unit of IMP+ cost; the run itself
costs at most nine hundred times `2 ^ k` per entry of the input
word. The product is the constant of the statement, and no part of it
was fought over.

The word length is dealt with in the same step and in the same place.
The value bound the driver runs under is the length of the input word
plus the parameter — the parameter is an entry of the word, so it has
to be a word, and the stack indices and budgets are below it, while
everything else is below the length. The statement's hypothesis, that
`9000(|x| + k + 1)` is a word, gives that bound and the span of the
layout at it, `24 + 6(|x| + k)`, with a margin nobody has to compute.
It is deliberately not the hypothesis that the *running time* is a
word: `2 ^ k` is a count of steps, not a number the machine ever holds.

Vertex cover is fixed-parameter tractable with the parameter dependence
written into the bound: `vcProgram` decides, on every graph in
compressed sparse row form followed by the parameter `k`, whether the
graph has a vertex cover of at most `k` vertices, within
`9000 * 2 ^ k * (|x| + 1)` machine steps, at every word length at
which `9000 * (|x| + k + 1)` fits into a word.

# Proof strategy

The witness is the compiled driver `vcProgram`. Its IMP+ source
`vcCom` reads the encoding into the two arrays of the components driver
and the budget into a scalar, then runs the textbook bounded search
tree as a single loop on a mode scalar: descend scans for an edge with
neither endpoint marked and either answers `1`, gives up on the branch,
or pushes a frame and marks one endpoint; backtrack either answers `0`,
flips the top frame to its second endpoint, or pops it. `vcCom_run` is
that run, end to end.

Correctness is the invariant `Inv`, which splits the answer between the
active marking and the frames the search still owes: in descend mode
`Ok ∅ k` holds exactly if the current marking extends to a cover within
the remaining budget or some stored alternative does, in backtrack mode
exactly if some stored alternative does. Six transitions preserve it,
and `ans_eq` reads the concept's answer off the terminal state through
`ok_empty_iff`, the one place where mathlib's `vertexCoverNum` is
touched.

The cost is one amortized argument. The potential of a configuration is
`fPot b = 4·2 ^ b − 3` for the active subtree plus a stored child and
two units of slack per unflipped frame, and every one of the six
transitions strictly decreases it, so the whole tree is paid for by a
single application of the loop rule rather than by a recursion. The
scan inside a descend step is itself flat — one pointer over the target
array and one owner pointer, amortized over slots and owners together —
so a turn of the outer loop costs at most `100m + 50n + 100`. The
factor `2 ^ k` enters exactly once, as the potential of the initial
configuration: `pot ⟨[], 0, k, 0⟩ = 4·2 ^ k − 2`.

`computesInTime_of_solves` discharges the compiler, the layout
invariant and the machine in one step, charging `layout.const = 10`
machine steps per unit of IMP+ cost — an index computation is four
instructions, whatever the number of arrays. The array extents are chosen per
input, as that lemma allows: `vcExt n m k` declares `off ↦ n+1`,
`tgt ↦ 2m`, `mark ↦ n` and the three stack arrays `↦ k`, which is
exactly the depth the budget permits.

# Where the word length is paid for

The machine truncates every value modulo `2 ^ w`, so the run on the
machine is the run in the unbounded semantics only as long as nothing
the program computes reaches `2 ^ w`. The bound the driver is proved
under is `|x| + k`: every entry of the graph block is smaller than the
block is long, every quantity the algorithm keeps of the graph — vertex
numbers, offsets, the scan pointers — is bounded by `n` or by `2m`,
hence again by the length, and the two quantities that are not are the
parameter itself and the stack pointer and budget, which lie between
`0` and `k`. So the whole run needs the single hypothesis
`|x| + k ≤ B`, and the compiled program needs in addition that the
cells the layout addresses are words, which is `24 + 6(|x| + k)`. The
statement's hypothesis, that `9000(|x| + k + 1)` is a word, gives both
with room to spare.

What the hypothesis deliberately does *not* say is that the running
time fits into a word. `2 ^ k` counts steps of the search tree; it is
not a number the machine ever holds, since both children of a branch
run at one budget less and the budget is a scalar below `k`. Asking for
`2 ^ k` to be a word would make the claim vacuous exactly where the
algorithm is most interesting — a large parameter on an ordinary
machine — and would be a weaker theorem carrying the same bound.

# What the program is allowed to help itself to

*The budget is a scalar, not a field of the frames.* Both children of a
branch run at one budget less than their parent, so the budget is a
function of the stack depth alone — `bud + top = k` is part of the
invariant — and a push decrements it while a pop restores it. Nothing
is reconstructed on backtracking that was not written down, because
there is nothing to reconstruct.

*The mark array is never initialized.* Fresh memory is zero and `0` is
the marker for "unmarked", so the driver skips the clearing pass that
the components driver needs for its labels. This is not a saving hidden
from the bound: the bound is `2 ^ k` times linear and a clearing pass
is linear, so the pass would have been free. It is omitted because it
is unnecessary, not because it is expensive.

# Attribution

The opening result of parameterized complexity, by the textbook bounded
search tree — Downey and Fellows. The base 2 is the point of the
statement: no reduction rules are applied, and nothing here competes
with the refined analyses that beat it.
