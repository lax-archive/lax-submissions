`k`-expressions: the object the theorem takes as input.

Cliquewidth replaces treewidth as the width parameter of this
development, so the decomposition the program folds
over is a *`k`-expression*: a term built from labelled single vertices
by disjoint union, edge addition between two label classes, and
relabelling. The object itself — the syntax, the evaluator, validity,
and the numbering of the operations — **lives on the endorsement
surface**, in `concepts/Lax11/CliqueExpr.lean`, and is re-exported here
under the names the development already uses. What this file adds is
the handful of structural facts the congruences and the main induction
consume. No logic, no types, no programs.

Three decisions shape the surface object, all inherited from the
ambient-subset style of `MsoTypes.lean` and all aimed at keeping it
auditable in one sitting:

*Vertices are named globally by the leaves.* A leaf carries a vertex
name `v : Fin n`, and the vertex set of a subexpression is the finite
set of names of its leaves. So no node of the expression builds a fresh
structure that would have to be glued along an isomorphism: every
subexpression is a *subset* of the same ambient `Fin n`, disjoint union
is literally `∪`, and the disjointness that `⊕` needs is a consequence
of the leaf names being distinct (`Valid`). What does vary along the
tree is the graph — `addEdges` creates edges — which is why the
downstream statements are cross-graph; that is already the house style
(`typ_union_congr` is cross-ambient).

*Labels are sets, not a colouring.* `cls e i` is the `i`-th label class
of `e`, a `Finset (Fin n)`. A `k`-labelled graph is therefore an ambient
subset together with a `k`-tuple of sets, i.e. exactly the data
`typ q` already takes at `r = 0`, `s = k`: no marks anywhere in the
outer statements. The classes are pairwise disjoint and cover the
vertex set (`cls_disjoint`, `verts_eq_biUnion_cls`), but that is a
theorem about valid expressions, not part of the definition.

*Everything computes.* `verts`, `cls` and `opsOk` are `Finset`- and
`Bool`-valued, and `graph e` gets a `DecidableRel` instance by the same
structural recursion, so a hand-written expression can be `#eval`ed and
its edges `decide`d. The smoke test at the end of the file does exactly
that on the path `0—1—2` at `k = 2` — the house discipline, run before
anything was proved.

Validity has two clauses: the leaf names are distinct (`Nodup`), which
is what makes the two sides of every `⊕` disjoint, and the operations
are well formed (`addEdges i j` with `i ≠ j`, the standard restriction
on `η`). `ValidFor e G` adds the two root conditions, that the vertex
set is everything and the evaluated graph is `G`.

namespace Lax11Proofs.CliqueExpr

variable {n k : ℕ}

/-! ### The object

The expression type, its four evaluation recursions, the well-formedness
test and the two validity predicates are the surface definitions of
`Lax11.CliqueExpr`; the constructors are re-exported too, so that every
use site below reads as if they were declared here. The decidable
adjacency instance comes along with `graph` as an instance. -/

export Lax11.CliqueExpr (Expr Expr.leaf Expr.union Expr.addEdges Expr.relabel
  leafIds verts cls graph opsOk Valid ValidFor)

/-! The numbering of the operations is on the surface too — it is the
alphabet an expression is written in when it is handed to the machine,
so it is part of the input format. Only the *encoding* direction is
surface, since the instance encoding speaks `Op.code` alone; the
decoding direction is the fold's reading device and is defined here,
proof-side. `MsoTable.lean` proves the two facts about the numbering
that the fold needs. -/

export Lax11.CliqueExpr (Op Op.union Op.leaf Op.eta Op.rho Op.code opCard)

/-- The inverse of `Op.code`, total by sending every number that names
no operation to `union`. No surface statement consumes it — the
encoding of an instance requires every number in an expression block to
be the number of an operation, so an ill-formed number is never decoded
and totality is only what makes decoding a function. A code in one of
the two `k²` blocks is read in base `k`; that its digits are labels is
`Nat.div_lt_of_lt_mul` and `Nat.mod_lt`, the latter needing `0 < k`,
which the block itself supplies since no number is below `k²` when `k`
is zero. `MsoTable.lean` proves it inverts `Op.code`. -/
def Op.decode (k c : ℕ) : Op k :=
  if c = 0 then .union
  else if h : c - 1 < k then .leaf ⟨c - 1, h⟩
  else if h : c - 1 - k < k * k then
    have hk : 0 < k := Nat.pos_of_ne_zero (by rintro rfl; simp at h)
    .eta ⟨(c - 1 - k) / k, Nat.div_lt_of_lt_mul h⟩ ⟨(c - 1 - k) % k, Nat.mod_lt _ hk⟩
  else if h : c - 1 - k - k * k < k * k then
    have hk : 0 < k := Nat.pos_of_ne_zero (by rintro rfl; simp at h)
    .rho ⟨(c - 1 - k - k * k) / k, Nat.div_lt_of_lt_mul h⟩
      ⟨(c - 1 - k - k * k) % k, Nat.mod_lt _ hk⟩
  else .union

/-! ### The equations

Named `rfl` lemmas for the four recursions and for the operation codes,
so that no proof below — or in any file that consumes the surface — has
to `simp` with a definition written by pattern matching. That is not a
convenience: unfolding a concept definition by `simp` generates its
match splitter *in the proof package*, under the concept's namespace,
which the archive's namespace check rejects. -/

/-! ### The structural facts

Four facts, in the order the congruences and the main induction use
them: the vertex set is the set of leaf names; the label classes are
contained in it, cover it, and — for a valid expression — are pairwise
disjoint; the evaluated edges stay inside it; and the two sides of a
`⊕` are disjoint, which is the hypothesis the empty-pool composition
lemma needs. -/
