/-!
The tree-fold schema: a bottom-up fold over a parent-pointer tree,
driven by a table that the schema knows nothing about.

This is the shape every dynamic program on a tree decomposition has,
and it is built here once, generically, so that the algorithm and its
cost are settled before the mathematics that supplies the table exists.
The table is data — a finite function on a bounded alphabet — and the
program is generated from it: a prologue of stores materializes it into
arrays, and every use is then an array read. Nothing in the schema
requires the table to be *computed*; it may come from classical choice,
which is what lets the eventual type table be noncomputable.

Three decisions shape the file.

*The fold is sequential, not associative.* A node's value is a **left**
fold of its children's values, seeded by a value read off the node's own
label. Gluing a bag to its subtrees one child at a time is exactly this
shape, and it is not a fold of the children with each other: the seed
carries the node's own data, so the children are combined *into the
node*, never into one another. No commutativity, associativity or unit
is assumed anywhere.

*The children arrive in index order, and the sweep is one pass.* A node
is pushed into its parent as soon as it is finished, which is possible
because the encoding numbers children before parents. So the program
never searches for the children of a node — the quadratic trap — and
the order in which a node's children are folded is the increasing order
of their indices, which is what the pure model says too.

*There is no separate "adjust before passing up" table.* A unary map
applied to a value on its way to its parent is expressible by carrying
the node's label inside the value alphabet, and the table generation is
Lean-side and free. So the schema has two tables, not three, and the
per-node work is two array reads.

/-! ### The table

A table is a bounded alphabet of values, a bounded alphabet of labels,
a seed for each label, and a binary combination. It is `ℕ`-valued
throughout: the values of an eventual instantiation are numbered by an
enumeration of a `Fintype`, and the schema only ever needs the bound. -/

/-- The data driving a fold: values below `V`, labels below `L`, a seed
`init` for each label and a combination `step` of an accumulator with a
child's value. -/
structure Table where
  /-- Values are the naturals below this bound. -/
  V : ℕ
  /-- Labels are the naturals below this bound. -/
  L : ℕ
  /-- The value a node starts from, before any child is folded in. -/
  init : ℕ → ℕ
  /-- The accumulator after folding in one more child's value. -/
  step : ℕ → ℕ → ℕ

/-- A table is well-formed when its alphabet is closed under both
operations. This is all the program needs: every table lookup it makes
is then in range. -/
structure Table.Wf (T : Table) : Prop where
  /-- Seeds are values. -/
  init_lt : ∀ l < T.L, T.init l < T.V
  /-- Combinations of values are values. -/
  step_lt : ∀ a < T.V, ∀ b < T.V, T.step a b < T.V

/-- A bound admits a table when every number the materialized table
makes the machine hold is below it. There are two: a label, which
indexes the array of seeds, and a cell of the square combination table,
which is indexed by two values at once. Everything else the fold
produces is a value, and values are below `V ≤ V * V`. This is the only
way the size of the table enters the word-length hypothesis of a
program built on the schema — the *cost* of materializing it enters
separately, through the constant. -/
structure Table.Fits (T : Table) (B : ℕ) : Prop where
  /-- Labels are below the bound. -/
  label_le : T.L ≤ B
  /-- Every cell of the square combination table is below the bound. -/
  square_le : T.V * T.V ≤ B

/-- Values are below the bound, since a value is at most a cell index of
the square table. -/

/-! ### The pure model

The value of a node, by recursion on the tree, with no environment and
no program in sight. The recursion is bounded by an explicit fuel
rather than by well-founded recursion on the node index: the recursive
calls sit under a `foldl`, where the termination checker cannot see
that they are on smaller indices, and a fuel that is discharged once —
`valAux_eq_val` — costs less than fighting for it. -/

/-! ### The sweep, still pure

The program does not recurse: it runs an accumulator array over the
nodes in increasing order, pushing each finished node into its parent.
That sweep is a Lean recursion too, and the theorem that it computes
the tree fold is proved here, away from any environment — so that the
`Run` lemma has only representation left to do. -/

/-! ### The encoding

The instance word is the number of nodes, then the parent of each node,
then the label of each node. Children are numbered before parents and
the root is the last node — a rooted tree always admits such a
numbering, so the hypothesis costs no generality, and it is what makes
the sweep a single forward pass. The root's own parent entry is present
(the block has one number per node) and never read. -/

/-! ### The table, materialized

Three arrays hold the table. `ini` is the seed for each label. The
combination is a square array `tab` read at `a * V + b`, and since the
machine language has no multiplication, the row bases `a * V` are
themselves a table, `row`. So a combination costs two array reads and
one addition, and the program contains no arithmetic that depends on
the alphabet size. -/
