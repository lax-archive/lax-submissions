/-!
The search: scanning one block, emptying the queue, and the sweep over
the vertices.

Everything rests on one observation, which is what keeps the invariant
small: **a label, once written, is already the right one.** A vertex is
labelled only when it is found from a root `u` that was unlabelled when
the sweep reached it, and such a `u` is the least vertex of its own
component; so the label written is the label the answer calls for. The
array therefore always holds, at each vertex, either the marker `n` or
the true label, and the algorithm's remaining job is only to *reach*
every vertex.

`Base` is what holds throughout the run, whichever search is going on:
the labels are right or absent, the queue holds exactly the labelled
vertices without repetition, and everything before `head` has had its
whole block looked at — with its neighbours getting *its* label, not
the current root's, which is what makes that clause survive the change
of root. `Live` adds what holds only inside a search from `u`.

The queue is never reset, so `Base` speaks about all of it and the
searches are told apart only by `Live.cur`, the fact that the part
still to be expanded belongs to the current search. That is what buys
the cost argument its global budget.

Two numbers bound everything the search produces: `n`, which every
vertex, label and queue pointer stays below, and `2m`, which every
offset, scan pointer and slot counter stays below. So the value bound
of the bounded semantics enters as the two hypotheses `n < B` and
`2 * m < B` and adds nothing to the invariants — with one exception,
the slot counter, whose bound is the amortization argument itself and
is therefore passed in as `sc₀ + deg x v ≤ 2 * m` where the scan needs
it.

Everything below the invariants is the kit's. The body of the scan is
walked by `run_vcg`, so what is left of `scanBody_run` is what the two
paths *did*; the scan itself is `Csr.rowScan_spec`, which supplies the
loop condition, the exit fact `j = off (v+1)` and the cost of thirty a
slot; `expandBody` is walked end to end, its two offset reads entering
as `Csr.loadRow_spec`, a specification about a *prefix* of the block
rather than a node of it; and the search loop is `Queue.drain_run`,
which supplies the loop condition and the exit fact `head = tail`.

What none of that saves is the hand-off: a step that enters by a
specification gives back a state the walk knows nothing else about, so
every field of `ScanInv` and of `DrainInv` has to be re-established in
it. That, and not the reads, is what the length of this file is.

/-! ### The one change the arrays ever undergo

Labelling an unlabelled vertex with its own label and putting it on the
back of the queue: that is the whole of what the search writes, and the
sweep writes it too when it starts a search from a root. So the clauses
of `Base` and `Live` are re-established here once rather than at each of
the two sites. -/

/-- Labelling the unlabelled vertex `w` with its own label and enqueuing
it. The queue clauses survive because `w` was not on the queue — nothing
unlabelled is — and the expansion clause because nothing already
expanded can name `w` either. -/

/-- **The search.** The queue is emptied, and the whole cost of doing
so is paid out of the potential — including the scans, whose cost no
constant per turn of the loop could bound. The loop is the kit's
`Queue.drain_run`: the queue supplies the loop condition and the exit
fact `head = tail`, and what is left here is the one thing that is this
algorithm's, that a turn pays for itself. The relational form is the one
to use, since the sweep this loop sits in draws on the same potential
and needs back the credit the queue still holds. -/
