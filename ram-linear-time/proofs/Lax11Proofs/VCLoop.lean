/-!
The outer loop: one transition lemma for the body, then the loop rule.

`Rep` says what the arrays and scalars hold when the pure configuration
is `C`: the stack arrays list the frames bottom-up — entry `i` is frame
`i` counted from the bottom, which is `C.frames.reverse[i]`, since the
pure stack keeps its top at the head — and the mark array is the
indicator of the marked set. The invariant handed to the loop rule is
"some configuration is represented, and it satisfies `Inv`".

The loop potential must be a total function of the environment, so it
cannot read the pure configuration; `phasesOf` reads the phase list
back off the stack array — garbage off the invariant is fine, since
only invariant states are ever compared — and `potN` mirrors `pot` on
it. On represented states the two agree, which is the one lemma that
crosses between the numeric and the pure potential.

Each body case builds its `Run` by hand, hands the new configuration to
the matching preservation lemma of `VCSpec`, and pays the loop rule out
of the matching drop lemma. The descend cases contain the scan; their
cost is `≤ 100m + 50n + 96`, which is why the loop potential carries
the factor `100m + 50n + 104`.

The value bound is four hypotheses and no invariant clause. Beyond what
the scan needs, the search produces stack indices and budgets, both
below `k`, and the marks and modes, which are `0`, `1` or `2`; so `2`,
`n`, `2m` and `k` being words is the whole of it, and in particular the
`2 ^ k` of the running time is nowhere among the numbers held.

/-! ### The body of the outer loop

Six transitions, three theorems. Descend runs the scan and then either
exits with `1`, gives up on the branch, or pushes a frame; backtrack
either exits with `0`, flips the top frame, or pops it. Each case names
the new configuration, builds its `Run` by hand, re-establishes every
clause of `Rep`, hands the configuration to the matching preservation
lemma and pays the loop rule out of the matching drop lemma. -/

reaches a represented state whose configuration still satisfies the
invariant and whose potential has dropped, within `100m + 50n + 96`
steps. -/

/-! ### The loop

One application of `Run.while_potential`. The invariant is "some
configuration is represented and satisfies `Inv`, and the tapes are
untouched"; the potential is the numeric one, scaled by the cost of a
turn. Each turn pays `1 + 3` for the test and at most `100m + 50n +
100` for the body, and buys one unit of `pot`, so the factor `100m +
50n + 104` covers it. -/

/-- **The search loop.** From a represented state satisfying the
invariant, the outer loop reaches a represented, invariant state in
mode `2`, in at most `(100m + 50n + 104) · pot C₀ + 4` steps. -/
