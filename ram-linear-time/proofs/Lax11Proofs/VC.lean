/-!
The driver: the bounded search tree for vertex cover, as an IMP+
program.

The algorithm is the plan's. After the read phase — the CSR block into
`off` and `tgt` exactly as in the components driver, then one more
`read` for the budget — the machine runs one outer loop over a mode
scalar: descend (`0`) scans for an uncovered edge and either answers,
gives up on the branch, or pushes a frame and marks an endpoint;
backtrack (`1`) either answers, flips the top frame to its second
branch, or pops it; done (`2`) exits. The stack lives in three arrays
`stkU`, `stkV`, `stkP` with a `top` scalar; the budget is a scalar,
since in the `2^k` tree both children run at one budget less and no
frame needs to store it.

The scan is a single flat loop: one pointer `j` over the target array
and one owner `u`, and each iteration either advances the owner past an
exhausted block or examines one slot — no inner loop, which keeps it
one application of the loop rule. Loops exit early by assigning their
counters to their bounds (`j := m2`), the house idiom for `break`,
since a condition is a single comparison. The mark array needs no
initialization: fresh arrays are zeroed and the marker for "unmarked"
is `0`.

/-! ### The program, run

House discipline: the compiled machine program is run before anything
is proved about it. The instances below cover both answers at the
boundary budgets, the `k = 0` cases, the empty graph, and one malformed
word, which must merely not diverge. The word length is fixed at
sixteen, which is more than these instances need; the step counts do
not depend on it. -/

every number these instances produce. -/
