/-!
The sweep over the vertices, and the driver end to end.

The searches are behind us; what is left is to say that starting one at
every unlabelled vertex labels everything. Two clauses carry that. *No
label above `u` has been written* makes an unlabelled vertex the least
of its component — nothing below it can have reached it, or it would
carry that smaller label — which is what licences labelling it with
itself. *Every component below `u` is done* is what the exit argument
of the search hands back, and at `u = n` it says every vertex is
labelled, so the array holds the answer.

The potential of the sweep is the search's plus a constant per vertex
not yet swept. It is one potential for the whole loop, so the searches
are never counted separately: a search that runs long has already
consumed the slots and the queue room it is paid out of, and the sweep
around it only ever pays the per-vertex constant.

The driver takes its value bound from the input word and nothing else:
every number it ever holds is a vertex, an offset, a counter of either,
or a number it read, and each of those is below the length of the word,
by `mem_lt_length` and by the encoding's own conditions. So the single
hypothesis `x.length ≤ B` is what the whole run needs, and it is what
becomes the word-length hypothesis of the statement.

The driver's thirteen commands are walked by `run_vcg`, which assembles
the run, adds the costs and proves the announced bound. It is handed
three specifications, and the *grouping* is what matters: the four
commands that fill the arrays go over as one, matched as a prefix of the
block. A handed specification gives back a state the walk knows nothing
else about, so every fact the sweep needs must be carried in a
postcondition — but inside one specification those facts are read off
the runs it already holds, one `frame_var` apiece and at any distance.
Forward composition pays per phase; a frame lookup pays per fact.

`outerBody_run` stays hand-built, and honestly so: a turn of the sweep
pays for itself out of the potential, which neither a `Spec`'s single
cost nor the walk's `K ≤` shape can state.
