# Point this checkout's cross-submission dependencies at its own sibling
# folders, so `lake build` uses the working tree instead of the pinned commits.
# Pure local bookkeeping — no arguments, idempotent, safe to rerun:
#
#   .claude/sibling-overrides.sh
#
# Why it exists. The spec forbids a sibling `path` require across submissions:
# every cross-submission edge must be a `(git, rev, subDir)` triple equal to the
# dependency's current archive record, so a submission's commit transitively
# pins its whole source closure. Checked-in lakefiles therefore name commits,
# not siblings — but a commit is worthless while both submissions are still
# being written, and rebuilding a dependency's pinned clone from source is a
# pointless hour. Lake's package overrides close that gap: an entry in
# `<pkg>/.lake/package-overrides.json` replaces a manifest entry of the same
# name after manifest validation, so the pins stay honest in git while the
# build reads the folder next door. Both files are generated and gitignored
# (`lax build` rejects a checked-in overrides file outright).
#
# What it writes, per package, for the transitive closure of its
# cross-submission requires:
#   - lake-manifest.json           the locked `git` entry the lakefile declares
#     (from the archive record), so lake never reports the manifest out of date
#     and never suggests the forbidden `lake update`;
#   - .lake/package-overrides.json a `path` entry redirecting that same name to
#     the sibling folder, relative to the package — so the file survives being
#     copied into a worktree (see worktree-seed.sh).
# Existing entries are merged, not replaced: the warm-store redirects lax wrote
# for mathlib and friends stay exactly as they are.
#
# Rerun it after `lax build`, which rewrites both files from the pins alone —
# that is the honest, archive-faithful build, and it is what `lax submit` and
# the server do. This script is for the fast local loop only.
