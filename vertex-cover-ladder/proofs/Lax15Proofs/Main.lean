The loop, the assembly, and the theorem.

Three things are left. The outer loop is one application of the loop
rule: the invariant is "some configuration is represented and satisfies
`J`, and the tapes are untouched", the potential is the pure one read
back off the two stack arrays, and the body of `Loop.lean` pays for a
turn out of it. The assembly is the read phase — the components
driver's, one `read` longer, exactly as in the `2^k` driver — followed
by the loop and one `write`. And the theorem is the concept's, cashed
in through the transfer theorem.

The potential the loop rule sees is a function of the environment, and
it may not consult the pure configuration. `framesOf` reads the stored
budget–phase pairs off `stkB` and `stkP` below `top`, totally: on a
represented state it is the pure stack, and off one it is whatever the
arrays happen to hold, which the loop rule never asks about. This is
the only place where the choice of `Config.lean`'s potential pays off —
`potN` reads exactly those two arrays and nothing else, so the crossing
is one `List.ext_getElem`.

The layout costs the machine `10` steps per unit of IMP+ cost — the
compiler's constant, the same for every layout — and the run itself
costs at most `2100 · fib (k+2)` per entry of the input word. The
product `21000` is the constant of the statement, and no part of it was
fought over.

/-! ### The loop

One application of `Run.while_potential`. A turn pays `1 + 3` for the test and
at most `510 · (n + 2m + 1)` for the body, and buys one unit of `pot`,
so the scale `514 · (n + 2m + 1)` covers it. The whole search is
therefore paid for by the potential of the configuration it starts
from — and that potential is where, and only where, `fib (k + 2)`
enters. -/

invariant, the outer loop reaches a represented, invariant state in
mode `2`, in at most `514 · (n + 2m + 1) · pot C₀ + 4` steps. -/

conclusion: Lax15.VertexCover.exists_fibTime_program_vertexCover
---
Vertex cover is decided in Fibonacci-of-`k` time: `vcfProgram` decides,
on every graph in compressed sparse row form followed by the parameter
`k`, whether the graph has a vertex cover of at most `k` vertices,
within `21000 * fib (k + 2) * (|x| + 1)` machine steps, at every word
length at which `21000 * (|x| + k + 1)` fits into a word.

# Proof strategy

The witness is the compiled driver `vcfProgram`. Its IMP+ source
`vcfCom` reads the encoding into the two arrays of the components driver
and the budget into a scalar, then runs a bounded search tree that
branches on a *vertex* rather than on an edge, as a single loop on a
mode scalar. Descend makes one pass over the target array and either
answers, gives up on the branch, or pushes a frame on a vertex `v` with
two or more residual neighbours, marking `v`; backtrack either answers
`0`, flips the top frame to its second branch — marking the whole
residual neighbourhood of its vertex, which costs at least two units of
budget — or pops it. `vcfCom_run` is that run, end to end.

Correctness is the invariant `J`, which splits the answer between the
active marking and the alternatives the frames still owe: in descend
mode `Ok ∅ k` holds exactly if the current marking extends to a cover
within the remaining budget or some stored alternative does, in
backtrack mode exactly if some stored alternative does. Eight
transitions preserve it, each resting on one of three graph lemmas —
that at most `b` residual edges admit a cover within `b`, that a
residual matching of more than `b` edges admits none, and that
branching on a vertex is exhaustive — and `ans_eq` reads the concept's
answer off the terminal state, the one place where mathlib's
`vertexCoverNum` is touched.

The cost is one amortized argument. The potential of a configuration is
`fPot b = 4·fib (b + 2) − 3` for the active subtree, plus `fPot (b−2) +
2` for each frame whose second branch is still owed and one unit for
each frame already on it, and every one of the eight transitions
strictly decreases it, so the whole tree is paid for by a single
application of the loop rule rather than by a recursion. The push is
where the recurrence is discharged: `fPot (b−1) + fPot (b−2) + 3 ≤
fPot b` holds with equality, and that is exactly what the Fibonacci
identity buys over the doubling one. A turn of the outer loop costs at
most `510 · (n + 2m + 1)` — the descend scan is flat, one pointer over
the target array with the block owner walking alongside, and the flip
and the pop are bounded by a row and by the trail. The factor
`fib (k + 2)` enters exactly once, as the potential of the initial
configuration: `pot ⟨[], 0, k, 0⟩ = 4·fib (k + 2) − 2`.

`computesInTime_of_solves` discharges the compiler, the layout
invariant and the machine in one step, charging `vcfLayout.const = 10`
machine steps per unit of IMP+ cost — the compiler's constant, which is
the same for every layout, since an array access is four instructions
whatever the number of arrays. The array extents are chosen per input,
as that lemma allows: `vcfExt n m` declares `off ↦ n+1`, `tgt ↦ 2m`,
`mark ↦ n`, and the trail and the four stacks `↦ n+1`, which is what
frame health permits, since the frames mark disjoint nonempty sets of
vertices and so there are at most `n` of them.

# Where the word length is paid for

The machine truncates every value modulo `2 ^ w`, so the run on the
machine is the run in the unbounded semantics only as long as nothing
the program computes reaches `2 ^ w`. The bound the driver is proved
under is `|x| + k`: every entry of the graph block is smaller than the
block is long, every quantity the algorithm keeps of the graph — vertex
numbers, offsets, the scan pointers, the trail height and the stack
height — is bounded by `n` or by `2m`, hence again by the length, and
the two quantities that are not are the parameter itself and the
budgets stored in the frames, which lie between `0` and `k`. So the
whole run needs the single hypothesis `|x| + k ≤ B`, and the compiled
program needs in addition that the cells the layout addresses are
words, which is `32 + 8(|x| + k)`. The statement's hypothesis, that
`21000(|x| + k + 1)` is a word, gives both with room to spare.

What the hypothesis deliberately does *not* say is that the running
time fits into a word. `fib (k + 2)` counts the leaves of the search
tree; it is not a number the machine ever holds, and nothing in the
program ever computes a Fibonacci number — there is no multiplication
anywhere in `vcfCom`, and the budgets it manipulates are below `k`.
Asking for `fib (k + 2)` to be a word would make the claim vacuous
exactly where the algorithm is most interesting, and would be a weaker
theorem carrying the same bound. The admissible set is character for
character the one of the `2 ^ k` statement, so the improved bound is
claimed on exactly the same instances.

# What the program is allowed to help itself to

*Each frame stores its own budget.* Unlike the `2 ^ k` driver, the two
children of a branch do not cost the same: the first spends one unit,
the second spends the residual degree. So the budget is not a function
of the stack depth and cannot be recovered by counting frames; `stkB`
records it at the push and both the flip and the pop restore it from
there. Nothing is reconstructed on backtracking that was not written
down.

*The marks are undone by a trail, not by name.* A frame on its second
branch marks a whole neighbourhood, so unmarking it is not one store.
Each frame records the trail height it found in `stkT`, and a pop walks
the trail back down to that height, unmarking as it goes. The trail is
what makes the pop's cost linear in what the frame marked rather than in
the vertex set, and its total length is at most `n` because the frames'
marked sets are disjoint and nonempty.

*The mark array is never initialized.* Fresh memory is zero and `0` is
the marker for "unmarked", so the driver skips the clearing pass. The
bound is `fib (k + 2)` times linear and a clearing pass is linear, so
the pass would have been free; it is omitted because it is unnecessary,
not because it is expensive.

*The branch test does not count slots.* The encoding may name a
neighbour of a vertex several times, so two unmarked slots in a block
are no evidence of two residual neighbours, and the residual owner
count `ro` is capped at one per block for the same reason. Both are the
reason the bound is Fibonacci rather than merely correct: a slot-counting
test would branch on a matching whose blocks repeat, and search a
`2 ^ k` tree on an instance this program answers without a push.

# Attribution

The vertex-branching bounded search tree for vertex cover, with the
Fibonacci recurrence `T(k) ≤ T(k−1) + T(k−2)` and the matching leaf —
Downey and Fellows for the parameterized setting, and the analysis as it
appears in Cygan et al. The base `φ ≈ 1.618` is the point of the
statement: no reduction rules are applied, and nothing here competes
with the refined analyses that beat it.
