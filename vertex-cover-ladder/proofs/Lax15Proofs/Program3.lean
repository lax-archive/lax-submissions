/-!
The second driver: the branch-and-solve search tree for vertex cover, as
an IMP+ program.

The algorithm is the rung-B plan's. Everything outside the descend phase
is rung A's, reused **by name** — the read phase (`readLoop`), the push
(`pushFrame`), the backtrack dispatch with its flip and its pop
(`backtrackBody`, `flipFrame`, `popFrame`) — so that the Run lemmas
already proved about those blocks (`flipFrame_eq`, `popFrame_eq`,
`rowLoop_run`, `unwind_run`) apply here unchanged. Two things are new.

The **branching test** is raised from two to three. Rung A branches on a
vertex with two residual neighbours, which costs `1` and `2` units of
budget and gives `fib`; here a vertex is a branching vertex only when it
has *three* distinct residual neighbours, so the two children cost `1`
and `3` and the leaf count obeys `T(b) ≤ T(b-1) + T(b-3)`.

The price of the sharper test is that the leaf is no longer a counting
argument. Rung A's leaf was a matching: with every residual degree at
most one the residual graph is a matching and its cover number is its
edge count, which one pass can count. Here the leaf has every residual
degree at most *two*, so the residual graph is a disjoint union of paths
and cycles, and its cover number is `∑_C ⌈e_C / 2⌉` over the connected
components. That sum is what the **solver block** computes: a
breadth-first sweep in the shape of the components driver, one component
at a time, counting each residual edge once and halving the count with a
toggle. The toggle is the halving — the machine has no division, and
`⌈e/2⌉` is exactly what a flag flipped once per edge, and counted only
when it is down, accumulates.

### The scan

One descend pass walks the target array once, `j` from `0` to `2m`, with
the block owner `u` walking alongside; the inner owner loop is rung A's,
amortized over the pass. What the pass computes is only `found`: the
per-owner registers are now `seen ∈ {0, 1, 2}`, `t1` and `t2`, the first
and second *distinct* unmarked target of the current block, and the flag
is raised on a third distinct one. `v` records the first such owner.
`ro` and `cnted` are gone with the matching leaf.

The scan **runs to completion**; there is no early exit. It could have
one — nothing after the first branching vertex is read — and the machine
model's idiom for `break` is to force the loop counter to its bound. The
full pass is chosen instead, for three reasons: the cost bound is the
same either way (one pass over `2m` slots, which is what the potential
already pays for), the loop invariant stays the plain "`found` says
whether some owner below `j` has three distinct unmarked targets" with no
disjunction for the forced state, and — the deciding one — it keeps the
scan syntactically parallel to rung A's `descendScan`, whose Run lemma
B4 imitates line for line.

### The solver

At `¬ found` every unmarked vertex has at most two distinct unmarked
neighbours. The solver clears `vis`, sets `s := 0`, and sweeps the roots
`r = 0, …, n-1`. An unmarked, unvisited root opens a component: it is
visited, enqueued, the toggle is set to `0` — **per component**, which is
what makes the sum a sum of ceilings rather than one ceiling — and the
queue is drained. Draining dequeues `u`, scans its block with the *same*
`seen`/`t1`/`t2` dedup as the descend scan, and for each distinct
unmarked target `w` does two things: it counts the edge `{u, w}` if
`u < w`, so that each residual edge is counted at the one endpoint that
is smaller and hence exactly once; and it visits and enqueues `w` if `w`
is unvisited. The queue is never reset between components, as in the
components driver: `vis` is set before the enqueue, so each vertex is
enqueued at most once per solver call and `tl ≤ n`.

The dedup admits a third distinct target syntactically — the shared
`dedupStep` has a slot for it — and the solver's third slot is `skip`.
Under `¬ found` that branch is unreachable, and the Run proof shows it
so; what matters for the reading of the program is that a third distinct
target would be **skipped, not counted**, so the count never exceeds the
residual edge count even off the invariant.

Then `s ≤ bud` answers `1` and stops, and otherwise the branch is
abandoned: `mode := 1`.

### The dedup, once

The `seen`/`t1`/`t2` dedup is literally one definition, `dedupStep`,
used by both scans; the two differ only in the three commands they hang
on the first, second and third distinct target. In the descend scan
those are `skip`, `skip`, `recordFound` — rung A's `recordFound`, reused;
in the solver they are `countPush`, `countPush`, `skip`.

### The names

Scalars, in the order of the layout:

* `n`, `m` — the vertex and edge counts, off the tape.
* `m2` — `2 * m`, the length of the target array (computed as `m + m`;
  there is no multiplication anywhere in this program).
* `len` — `n + 1`, the length of the offset array.
* `i`, `t` — the read loop's counter and cell (Lax11's `readLoop`); `i`
  is also the counter of the solver's `vis`-clearing pass, which runs
  long after the last read.
* `j` — the slot pointer: of the descend scan, of the solver's row scan,
  and of the flip's row scan.
* `u` — the block owner of the descend scan, and the dequeued vertex of
  the solver's drain.
* `w` — the target of slot `j`, in all three scans.
* `jend` — the end of a row scan, `off[u+1]` or `off[pv+1]`.
* `seen`, `t1`, `t2` — the per-owner registers of the dedup: how many
  distinct unmarked targets this block has shown (`0`, `1`, `2`) and
  which they are. Reset on owner advance in the descend scan, and at the
  start of each row in the solver.
* `found`, `v` — the branching flag and the branching vertex.
* `top` — the number of frames on the stack.
* `tt` — the trail height.
* `bud` — the remaining budget.
* `mode` — `0` descend, `1` backtrack, `2` done.
* `ans` — the answer, written at the end.
* `sp` — `top - 1`, the index of the top frame.
* `pv`, `pb`, `tb` — the top frame's vertex, stored budget and trail
  base, read out of `stkV`, `stkB`, `stkT`.
* `d` — `tt - tb`, the size of the residual neighbourhood a flip marked.
* `head`, `tl` — the solver's queue pointers, both reset once per solver
  call and monotone across its components.
* `s` — the solver's accumulated cost, `∑_C ⌈e_C / 2⌉`.
* `tog` — the halving toggle, reset at the root of each component.
* `r` — the solver's root sweep counter.

Rung A's `ro` and `cnted` are gone: there is no owner count here.

Arrays, in the order of the layout, with the extents the proofs give
them:

* `off` (extent `n + 1`), `tgt` (extent `2m`) — the encoding.
* `mark` (extent `n`) — the indicator of the marked set.
* `trail` (extent `n + 1`) — the marked vertices in the order they were
  marked.
* `stkV`, `stkB`, `stkT`, `stkP` (extent `n + 1`) — the frames: the
  vertex branched on, the budget at the push, the trail height at the
  push, and the phase (`0` first branch, `1` second).
* `vis` (extent `n`) — the solver's visited indicator, cleared at the
  start of every solver call. Fresh arrays are zeroed, so the first call
  would not need the pass; every later one does.
* `q` (extent `n`) — the solver's queue. Each unmarked vertex is
  enqueued at most once per call, because `vis` is set before the
  enqueue, so `tl ≤ n`.

A condition is a single comparison, so `x ≤ y` is written `x < y + 1`
and `w ≠ t` is two strict comparisons in nested `ite`s — the `neTest`
combinator, which is why the third-target command appears four times in
the elaborated tree of `dedupStep` and is therefore always a name.

/-! ### The program, run

House discipline: the compiled machine program is run before anything is
proved about it. Every expected answer below was derived by hand first —
a cover witness for a `yes`, a counting argument for a `no` — and the
derivation is the comment above the guard. The instances cover both
branches of the descend dispatch, both verdicts of the solver, the flip
(feasible and infeasible), the pop, the empty budget, the empty graph,
one malformed word which must merely not diverge, and the two dedup
regressions: an encoding that names a neighbour twice, and a disjoint
matching whose every slot is doubled.

The residual-graph facts the derivations use: below the branching
threshold every unmarked vertex has at most two distinct unmarked
neighbours, so the residual graph is a disjoint union of paths and
cycles, and its cover number is `∑_C ⌈e_C / 2⌉` — a path with `e` edges
costs `⌈e/2⌉`, a cycle with `e` edges costs `⌈e/2⌉`, an isolated vertex
costs nothing. The word length is fixed at sixteen, which is more than
these instances need; the step counts do not depend on it. -/

holds every number these instances produce. -/

/-! #### Against rung A

The same instances on `vcfCom`, where they are not already guarded in
`Program.lean`. The picture is the one the two recurrences predict, with
a constant against rung B: the solver is a second pass over the graph
where rung A's matching leaf was fused into the branching scan. The two
extra arrays of rung B's layout cost nothing per access — the compiler
charges four instructions for an array index whatever the number of
arrays — so the whole difference is that second pass.

Rung B wins outright exactly where the branching bites and its leaf is
strictly stronger. On `C₇` — every degree two, so rung A branches to a
depth its Fibonacci tree pays for while rung B answers at the first
leaf — it is `13999` against `5234` at `k = 3` and `7714` against `5201`
at `k = 4`. On the `K`-family the two effects nearly cancel at these
sizes: `K₄` is `5891/4824` (A) against `5459/4884` (B) — rung B ahead on
the `no`, behind on the `yes`, since both programs push the same number
of times and rung B pays for the solver at the leaf — and `K₅` is
`11451/9657` (A) against `10588/9331` (B), where the deeper tree tips
both answers to rung B. Where there is nothing to branch on and the leaf
is a matching, rung A's fused count is simply cheaper: `P₄` is
`2518/2038` against `2820/2787`, the repeating word `862/829` against
`1500/1467`, and the doubled `2K₂` `1574/1541` against `2527/2494`. None
of this is the asymptotics; it is the constant, and the asymptotics is
what the concept states. -/
