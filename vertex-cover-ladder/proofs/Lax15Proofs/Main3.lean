The second rung's loop, assembly, and theorem.

The three pieces are the first rung's, with one clause added to each.
The outer loop is one application of the loop rule: the invariant is
"some configuration is represented, carries the side invariant and
satisfies `J3`, and the tapes are untouched", the potential is `pot3`
read back off the two stack arrays, and `Loop3.lean`'s body pays for a
turn out of it. The assembly is the read phase — rung A's, unchanged,
since the two drivers read the same word — followed by the loop and one
`write`; what is new is that the read phase must hand the loop the side
invariant as well, which is where the array extents `vis ↦ n` and
`q ↦ n` are chosen. And the theorem is the concept's, cashed in through
the transfer theorem.

The potential the loop rule sees is a function of the environment, and
it may not consult the pure configuration. `framesOf` — rung A's, reused
verbatim, since the stack arrays and their meaning did not change —
reads the stored budget–phase pairs off `stkB` and `stkP` below `top`,
totally, and `potN3` is a function of those pairs alone, so the crossing
is rung A's `framesOf_eq` and nothing more.

The layout costs the machine `10` steps per unit of IMP+ cost — the
compiler's constant, the same for every layout — and the run itself
costs at most `6500 · branchCount k` per entry of the input word. The
product `65000` is the constant of the
statement, and no part of it was fought over: `1610` for a turn of the
outer loop and `4` for its test make `1614`, times the four units of
`pot3` that the initial budget is worth, is `6456`, and the rest is
slack for the read phase.

/-! ### The potential, read off the arrays

The loop rule's potential is a function of the environment alone. The
reading of the stack is rung A's `framesOf`; only what is summed over it
changes. -/

/-- On a represented state the numeric potential is the pure one. -/
theorem potN3_eq {C : Config n} {τ : Env} (hRep : Rep n m O T C τ)

  rw [hRep.mode, hRep.bud, framesOf_eq hRep hlen, ← pot3_eq_potN3]

/-! ### The loop

One application of `Run.while_potential`. A turn pays `1 + 3` for the test and
at most `1610 · (n + 2m + 1)` for the body, and buys one unit of `pot3`,
so the scale `1614 · (n + 2m + 1)` covers it. The whole search is
therefore paid for by the potential of the configuration it starts
from — and that potential is where, and only where, `branchCount k`
enters. -/

/-- **The search loop.** From a represented state satisfying the
invariant and the side invariant, the outer loop reaches a represented,
invariant state in mode `2`, in at most
`1614 · (n + 2m + 1) · pot3 C₀ + 4` steps. -/

conclusion: Lax15.VertexCoverBranch.exists_branchTime_program_vertexCover
---
Vertex cover is decided in `branchCount k` time: `vcf3Program` decides,
on every graph in compressed sparse row form followed by the parameter
`k`, whether the graph has a vertex cover of at most `k` vertices,
within `65000 * branchCount k * (|x| + 1)` machine steps, at every word
length at which `65000 * (|x| + k + 1)` fits into a word.

# Proof strategy

The witness is the compiled driver `vcf3Program`, the second of this
submission's two. Its IMP+ source `vcf3Com` reads the encoding into the
two arrays of the components driver and the budget into a scalar — the
Fibonacci driver's read phase, character for character — and then runs a
bounded search tree as a single loop on a mode scalar. What changed is
the descend phase. One pass over the target array asks whether some
unmarked vertex has **three** distinct unmarked neighbours; if it does,
the search branches on it, at a cost of one unit of budget for the
branch that takes it and at least three for the branch that takes its
neighbourhood, so the leaf count obeys
`branchCount b = branchCount (b−1) + branchCount (b−3)`. If none does,
the branch is not searched at all: every unmarked vertex then has at
most two distinct unmarked neighbours, the residual graph is a disjoint
union of paths and cycles, and a solver block decides the whole subtree
outright. `vcf3Com_run` is that run, end to end.

The solver is the campaign's one genuinely new theorem. For a graph of
maximum degree two, the cover number is `∑_C ⌈e_C / 2⌉` over the
connected components. The upper bound is an induction on edges whose
step deletes the *neighbour of a degree-one vertex* when one exists and
any endpoint of an edge otherwise — the naive rule "delete any
degree-two vertex" is false, since deleting the middle vertex of a path
with four edges buys nothing — and the case where no degree-one vertex
exists is handled by a per-component handshake, so every degree in an
edge-bearing component is two. The lower bound is the observation that
a cover vertex covers at most two of its component's edges. The machine
computes that sum with a breadth-first sweep in the shape of the
components driver: one component at a time, each residual edge counted
once at its smaller endpoint, and the halving done by a toggle, since
the machine has no division.

Correctness is the invariant `J3`, which is the Fibonacci driver's `J`
together with one clause: every frame still owing its second branch was
pushed at residual degree at least three. `J` itself is reused as
stated — a branch at degree three satisfies its degree-two health clause
on the nose — and the extra clause is what feeds `d ≥ 3` to the flip,
which is the one transition whose drop needs it and the one place where
the fact is no longer visible. The two leaves of the solver take
semantic guards, `Ok G (marked) bud` and its negation, which the solver
lemma supplies from the component sum.

The cost is one amortized argument. The potential of a configuration is
`fPot3 b = 4·branchCount b − 3` for the active subtree, plus
`fPot3 (b−3) + 2` for each frame whose second branch is still owed and
one unit for each frame already on it, and every one of the eight
transitions strictly decreases it, so the whole tree is paid for by a
single application of the loop rule rather than by a recursion. The push
is where the recurrence is discharged:
`fPot3 (b−1) + fPot3 (b−3) + 3 ≤ fPot3 b` holds with equality, including
at the two budgets where truncated subtraction bends the recurrence, and
that is exactly what the `−3` and the two units of slack per stored
frame are for. A turn of the outer loop costs at most
`1610 · (n + 2m + 1)` — the scan is one flat pass, the solver is one
clearing pass plus one breadth-first sweep in which each vertex is
enqueued once and each row scanned once, and the flip and the pop are
bounded by a row and by the trail. The factor `branchCount k` enters
exactly once, as the potential of the initial configuration:
`pot3 ⟨[], 0, k, 0⟩ = 4·branchCount k − 2`.

`computesInTime_of_solves` discharges the compiler, the layout invariant
and the machine in one step, charging `vcf3Layout.const = 10` machine
steps per unit of IMP+ cost — the compiler's constant, which is the same
for every layout, since an array access is four instructions whatever
the number of arrays. The array extents are chosen per input, as that
lemma allows: `vcf3Ext n m` declares `off ↦ n+1`, `tgt ↦ 2m`, and
`mark`, `vis`, `q ↦ n`, with the trail and the four stacks `↦ n+1`,
which is what frame health permits, since the frames mark disjoint
nonempty sets of vertices and so there are at most `n` of them. The
value bound the driver is proved under is `|x| + k`, exactly as one rung
down, with one unit more of room — `n + 2 < B` rather than `n + 1 < B`,
because the solver compares its accumulated cost, which is at most `n`,
against `bud + 1`. Nothing the program computes is the running time:
`branchCount k` counts leaves, is never held in a register, and there is
no multiplication anywhere in `vcf3Com`.

# What the program is allowed to help itself to

*The branch test compares targets; it does not count slots.* The
encoding may name a neighbour of a vertex several times, so three
unmarked slots in a block are no evidence of three residual neighbours.
The scan therefore keeps two registers `t1`, `t2` holding the first and
second *distinct* unmarked target of the current block and raises the
flag only on a third that differs from both. This is what makes the
bound `branchCount` rather than merely correct, and it is the same trap
the Fibonacci driver's `Repeats.lean` records at threshold two.

*The dedup is one definition, used twice.* The descend scan and the
solver's row scan share `dedupStep` literally; they differ only in the
three commands hung on the first, second and third distinct target —
`skip, skip, recordFound` in the scan, `countPush, countPush, skip` in
the solver. A third distinct target cannot occur in the solver, since it
runs only when the scan found none, and the Run proof shows that branch
unreachable; the program skips it rather than counting it, so the count
never exceeds the residual edge count even off the invariant.

*The halving is a toggle, not a division.* The machine has no division
instruction, and `⌈e/2⌉` is exactly what a flag flipped once per counted
edge, with the count taken only when the flag is down, accumulates. The
toggle is reset at the root of each component, which is what makes the
total a sum of ceilings rather than one ceiling of a sum — and the
difference is real: two paths of one edge each cost two, not one.

*Each edge is counted at its smaller endpoint.* Both endpoints of a
residual edge are dequeued during the drain, so the edge is seen twice;
counting it only when the dequeued vertex is the smaller of the two
counts it exactly once, with no auxiliary marking.

*The queue is not reset between components.* `vis` is set before the
enqueue, so each vertex is enqueued at most once per solver call and the
queue pointers stay below `n` across the whole root sweep; only `vis`
itself is cleared, once per call, at the start.

*Each frame stores its own budget, and the marks come off a trail.*
Both are the Fibonacci driver's, unchanged and for the same reasons: the
two children of a branch no longer cost the same, so the budget is not a
function of the stack depth and `stkB` records it; and a frame on its
second branch marks a whole neighbourhood, so `stkT` records the trail
height it found and the pop walks the trail back down to it.

*The mark array is never initialized.* Fresh memory is zero and `0` is
the marker for "unmarked". The solver's `vis` array is cleared on every
call because it is used on every call; `mark` is not, because it is not.

# Attribution

The bounded search tree for vertex cover branching on a vertex, and the
recurrence `T(b) ≤ T(b−1) + T(b−3)` from a branching vertex of degree at
least three, are standard parameterized algorithmics — Downey and
Fellows for the setting, and the analysis as it appears in Cygan et al.,
§3.1, where this is the first step of the sequence of refinements that
brings the base down further. The solver at the leaf — that a graph of
maximum degree two is a disjoint union of paths and cycles, each covered
by `⌈e/2⌉` vertices and no fewer — is folklore; the proof here is a
direct induction and borrows no argument. Nothing in this submission
competes with the refined analyses that go below `1.4656`; the statement
asks for what this branching rule gives and no more.
