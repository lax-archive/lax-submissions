Clause lemmas for `Lax3.SplitterGame.SplitterWins` and the win on an
edgeless arena. The recursion of `SplitterWins` reduces definitionally
on its budget constructors, so both clauses are `Iff.rfl`; they are
stated here once so that no proof ever hands the concept-side
definition name to a tactic. The same is done for the adjacency of
Lax199508's `deleteVerts`, the isolation move both clauses recurse
through.
