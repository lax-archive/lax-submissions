/-!
The two halves of the cover-computation phase of Grohe–Kreutzer–Siebertz
§6, each stated for data the program produces rather than for an
optimal ordering.

# The cover of an arbitrary ordering

The claim `Lax3.OrderedNeighborhoodCover.isNeighborhoodCover_wreach`
supplies the cover of any ordering, with its full proof in
`CoverConstruction`. The existential cover theorem applies it to an
ordering attaining the weak coloring number; this module applies it
to the ordering the program computes. Given any ordering `π` whose weak
`2r`-reachability sets have at most `k` elements, the fibers
`X u = {w | u ∈ wreach G π (2r) w}` form an `r`-neighborhood cover of
radius `2r` and degree `k`. The local `isNeighborhoodCover_wreach`
forwards to that concept claim, so the algorithm and the existential
cover theorem share the same proved construction.

# The ordering of an augmentation chain

The second half is the engine of their Theorem 6.2, their Lemmas 6.5
and 6.6: after enough rounds of tight transitive–fraternal
augmentation, a degeneracy ordering of the final orientation has all
weak reachability sets small.

Write `Arrow D u v` for "`u` is `v` or an in-neighbour of `v`" and call
`c` a *meet* of `a` and `b` when `Arrow D c a` and `Arrow D c b`: one
vertex fanning out to both ends.  The path lemma is

    a `G`-walk of length at most `2 ^ t` has a meet in `D (3 * t)`
    on its own support                            (`meet_of_walk`)

and it is proved by halving the walk.  Split a walk of length `2 ^ (t+1)`
in the middle; the two halves have meets `c₁`, `c₂` of `(a, mid)` and
`(mid, b)` after `3 * t` rounds.  Both `c₁` and `c₂` arrow into `mid`,
so one fraternal round links them; the winner arrows into one of the two
far ends, so one transitive round carries it across; and if that arc
comes out pointing the wrong way, a second transitive round links `a`
and `b` themselves, whereupon the meet is an endpoint.  Three rounds per
doubling — the augmentation "halves" a walk, and the two `Arrow`
lemmas `arrow_or_of_frat` and `arrow_or_of_trans`, which return an
undirected verdict because the process does not fix the direction of a
new arc, are the only facts about a round the induction uses.

The counting is then `wreach_ncard_le_of_augChain`.  If `u` is weakly
`r`-reachable from `v` along a walk `p`, take a meet `c ∈ p.support` in
the final orientation `D R`.  Then `c` is `v` or one of its at most `d`
in-neighbours; and `c` is `u` or `u` is a `D R`-neighbour of `c` lying
`π`-below `c`, because `u` is `π`-minimal on `p` and `c` lies on `p`.
Bounding the second choice is exactly a back-degree bound on the
underlying graph of `D R` under `π` — a degeneracy ordering — so the
count is `(d + 1) * (k + 1)`, the shape of their `2 (d + 1) ²`.

# What the program supplies

The greedy chain of `Augmentation` (its own degeneracy orientation of
`G`, then per-round greedy orientations of the fraternity graphs), the
in-degree bound `d` of its final round, and the vertex order produced by
one last bucket-queue degeneracy pass over the underlying graph of that
final round, as a permutation, together with its back-degree bound `k`.
`lowDegreeVertices_toGraph` is the reason such a `k` exists and is small:
an orientation of in-degree `d` has at most `d · |S|` edges inside every
`S`, so some vertex of `S` has degree at most `2 d` inside it, and greedy
elimination turns that into an ordering.  `isNeighborhoodCover_of_augChain`
is the one-line composition of the two halves, with `2 ^ t ≥ 2 · r` rounds
of slack for the cover radius.

say `c₁` now arrows into `c₂`.  Since `c₂` arrows into `b`, one
transitive round carries `c₁` across to `b` — unless the new arc points
backwards, `b` into `c₁`, in which case a further transitive round along
`b → c₁ → a` links the two endpoints, and whichever way *that* arc points
its tail is a meet of `a` and `b`. -/

carries a meet of its two endpoints on its own support.

# Proof strategy

Induction on `t`.  A walk of length at most `1` is an edge or a point,
and `D 0` orients `G`, so one of the endpoints is a meet.  A walk of
length at most `2 ^ (t+1)` splits at its `2 ^ t`-th vertex into two walks
of length at most `2 ^ t`; the halves have meets after `3 * t` rounds,
and `meet_merge` joins them in three more rounds, keeping the meet vertex
on the support. -/

**The weak reachability bound** (Lemma 6.6 of Grohe–Kreutzer–Siebertz).
Let `D` be an augmentation chain of `G` with `R` rounds, `d` a bound on
the in-degrees of its last orientation, and `π` an ordering under which
the underlying graph of that orientation has back-degrees at most `k` —
a degeneracy ordering.  Then every weak `r`-reachability set under `π`
has at most `(d + 1) * (k + 1)` elements, provided `2 ^ t ≥ r` for some
`t` with `3 * t ≤ R`.

# Proof strategy

Let `u` be weakly `r`-reachable from `v` along a walk `p` on which `u` is
`π`-minimal.  The path lemma gives a meet `c ∈ p.support` of `v` and `u`
in the last orientation.  On the `v` side, `c` is `v` or one of its at
most `d` in-neighbours.  On the `u` side, `c` is `u` — or `c` is an
in-neighbour of `u`, and then `u` is a neighbour of `c` with `π u < π c`,
since `u` is `π`-minimal on `p` and `c` lies on `p`; those number at most
`k` by the back-degree bound. -/
