# ND-MC rebase P0 / wave B4c — the **block-driven** carrier passes

`ClusterSynth` and `ExpandSynth` re-derived the descent's leaf passes
through the tower and, in doing so, named the floor that is left: every
one of them is a loop over the **carrier**, so a turn of the driver's
level loop costs `Θ(n)` even when the turn's cluster is a constant-size
set (2F/D-a for the fills, 2G/D-c and 2G/N-3 for the expansion). Over
the `k` centres of a level that is `Θ(n·k)`, and it is the term the
sublinear headline cannot carry.

This file removes it for the three shapes B4c owns. Each pass is
re-written to iterate the **turn's member list**

    Xmem[Xoff (cps k) .. Xoff (cps k + 1))

— the block-scan shape `ClusterSynth.scatPass` already runs (D2c) — and
each is stated at a cost in which the carrier does not occur:
`TrailRecursion`'s acceptance bar, "note what the cost function is a
function of", read one level up.

| pass | carrier form | block form here | cost |
|---|---|---|---|
| the turn's clear+load (D2a+D2b+D2c) | `OrderSynth.fillPass` at `n`, then the scan | §3 `blockLoad0` | `15·m₁ + 15·m + 30` |
| the mask passes (D3, D8, D9, C1) | `ClusterSynth.andPass`/`subPass` at `n` | §4 `bandPass`/`bsubPass` | `25·m + 4` / `29·m + 4` |
| the self-reading ones (D7d, D10) | `ClusterSynth.andSelfPass`/`subSelfPass` | §4 `bandSelfPass`/`bsubSelfPass` | ditto |
| the expansion (D6, C2, C3) | `ExpandSynth.expPass` at `n` | §5 `bexpPass` | `50·m + 30·d + 4` |

with `m` the block's size, `m₁` the **previous** turn's block size and
`d = degSum` the number of arena slots the block's members own —
`edges(block)`. **No cost function below takes `n`.**

## B4c/D-a — the write set of a turn is the previous turn's block, and
that is what makes the clear cheap

`fillCom (cluName j) 0` exists because the scan that follows it marks
only the block and the caller wants "and everything else is zero". At
the *first* turn of a level that is what a carrier fill is for; at every
later turn the only cells that are not already zero are the ones the
**previous** turn's scan marked, so zeroing the previous block restores
the same postcondition. §3 states that as an invariant which the pass
consumes and re-establishes, and §3's cost is the two blocks' sizes.

The alternative — `Iicf/IicfTrailArray`'s `treset`, which charges the
reset at the touch counter — buys the same asymptotics for a *stronger*
program (it needs no knowledge of which block was previous) at the price
of three cells per array and a `tset` per mark. It is the right device
when the write set is not known; here it *is* known, exactly, and it is
one `aget` away. §3 takes the cheaper road and §8 records the choice.

## B4c/D-b — the block-driven pass must not write off its block, and
that is the load-bearing clause

Every export below carries, next to its value clause, the **negative**
clause

    ∀ w, (∀ q ∈ [p₀, e), idx[q] ≠ w) → t.1[w]! = A₀[w]!

— the entry array survives off the block, cell for cell. That is what
makes the passes composable in a turn loop at all (the next turn's
precondition is the previous turn's postcondition), and it is what a
carrier pass can never say. §1's differential guards pin it as a
*difference*: on a carrier that is not already supported on the block,
the block-driven pass and the carrier pass **disagree**, and the guard
exhibits the cell they disagree at.

## B4c/D-c — the self-reading block passes need the block to be
injective, and the frame-reading ones do not

`ClusterSynth`'s 2F/D-c carries over, with one addition. A carrier pass
visits each cell once by construction. A block-driven pass visits the
cells `idx[p₀], …, idx[e-1]`, and nothing in the *program* stops a slot
list from naming a cell twice. For `bandPass`/`bsubPass` that is
harmless — the value written does not depend on the cell's contents, so
a repeat writes the same value again. For the **self-reading** passes it
is not: `g (g x b) b` is not `g x b`, and §1's negative control exhibits
a slot list on which the two differ. So `bandSelfPass_spec` and
`bsubSelfPass_spec` take the block's injectivity as a hypothesis. It is
free at every call site — `RamCover.CoverOut.block_inj` is exactly it —
but it is a hypothesis, and the integration wave has to thread it.

## B4c/D-d — the expansion's two currencies become "block" and
"edges(block)"

`ExpandSynth`'s outer loop is charged `E2 (iter expRowC) (iter expC)`
with the second currency's budget `off[n] - off[z]`, which telescopes
because the loop counter *is* the vertex. A block-driven loop's vertices
are `idx[p]` in whatever order the cover wrote them, so the budget
cannot be a difference of offsets: it is the sum

    degSum idx off a b = ∑_{q ∈ [a,b)} (off[idx[q]+1] - off[idx[q]])

and `Finset.sum_eq_sum_Ico_succ_bot` is what replaces the telescoping.
That sum is `edges(block)` — the arena slots the block's members own —
and it is the honest resource: over the centres of one level it sums to
the arena, exactly as the block sizes sum to the cover's write pointer.

## What is consumed rather than re-proved

`ClusterSynth.scatPass_spec` **is** the block-driven zeroing pass — at
`v := 0` rather than `1`, the same program, the same synthesis
(`ClusterSynth.scatSynth` is stated at a general `v`). `ClusterSynth`'s
`mopAget_le`/`mopAdd_le`/`mopPair_le`, `ExpandSynth`'s `expScan_le`,
`expF_le`, `hitUpto`, `expOf` and `expC`, and `ElimSynth2`'s
`while_pot_le`/`step_spec` carry everything else. Nothing here re-proves
a landed pass.

## House traps observed

`omega` is blind through `Ir.Val` and through tuple projections (`show`
first); `decide +kernel` for the numerals; never `simp [Codegen.embed]`;
junk cells are consumed in written order; loop states are assembled with
`mopPair`; `mopConstN` is the only mid-body scalar reset; compacted
loops carry their length in the invariant (B3's defect 1), which here is
the clause `e ≤ idx.length` inside every invariant rather than a side
condition.

/-! ## 1. Refute before prove

Every pass below as a computable function, run on `ClusterSynth`'s
three-block arena and on `ExpandSynth`'s path, and checked **twice**:
against the carrier pass's answer *on the block*, and against the entry
array *off* the block. The second is the wave's own novelty and every
one of its guards is a negative control — the two passes are made to
disagree, and the cell they disagree at is written out.

/-! ## 2. The turn's clear and load — the `Θ(n)` fill removed

`RamDriver.clusterLoad j` is `fillCom (cluName j) 0` then the block
scan, and 2F/D-a is that the fill is `12·n` **per cluster**. The pass
below replaces the fill by the *previous* turn's block scan at the
stored value `0`: the same program `ClusterSynth.scatPass`, the same
synthesis, one cell pinned differently — and a cost in which `n` does
not appear.

Two clauses carry it. `Supported` is what the caller owes and what the
pass gives back (B4c/D-a), and the no-write clause is what makes the
composition legal at all (B4c/D-b). -/

one synthesis is both halves of `blockLoad0`: the clear is the program
below with `"sv"` pinned to `0` and the load is the same program with
`"sv"` pinned to `1`.

**B4c/D-e — a general stored value keeps the increment off `"sv"`.**
2F/D-e recorded that at `v := 1` the frame matcher hands the pointer
bump the *first* cell of the context holding `1`, which in `loadSynth`
was `"sv"` and not `"one"`. At a general `v` that cannot happen — `"sv"`
holds a variable — so the program below reads `"one"` for the bump and
`"sv"` only for the store. That is what makes it instantiable at both
values, and it is why the composed `blockLoad0` needs *two* owned
constant cells and not one. -/

/-! ## 3. The block-driven mask passes

D3, D8, D9, C1 and their self-reading pair D7d, D10 — `ClusterSynth`
§§4–5 at a loop whose turns are the block's slots. The cell function is
unchanged; what changes is that the index is read out of the slot list
first and every array is then indexed **at the member**, which is one
`aget` more per turn and `n − m` turns fewer per pass.

The loop is proved once (§3.2) at an abstract body and cell function,
exactly as `ClusterSynth.binLoop_le` is, and §§3.3–3.4 supply the four
bodies. -/

/-! ### 3.5 The block pass **is** the carrier pass, under the invariant

The differential guards of §1 as a theorem: on a carrier where the first
source and the destination are both supported on the block, the
block-driven pass's answer and `ClusterSynth.andPass`'s agree at every
cell of the carrier. Off the block both are `0` — one because it did not
write, the other because it multiplied by a zero — and that is exactly
why the `Θ(n)` pass was redundant. -/

/-! ### 3.8 The frame-reading passes at executable `IMP+`

The tower programs above use the cover arena's global slot interval.
At the driver boundary there is a still cheaper equivalent interface:
`clusterLoad` has already copied that interval into the prefix
`mem[0 .. bq)`.  The two commands below walk this prefix directly.
They are genuine `Imp.Com`s, and the specifications are genuine
`Reasoning.Spec`s; in particular, this is the missing executable bridge
for the frame-reading half of B4c/N-4.

`blockMapCom` is kept generic because conjunction and difference have
the same indirect write pattern.  Its negative postcondition is the
load-bearing one from §3: every carrier cell not named by the prefix is
unchanged. -/

/-! ## 4. The block-driven expansion

`RamDriver.expandCom msk src dst` at a loop whose turns are the block's
members. `ExpandSynth` derived it over the carrier and named the floor
it leaves (2G/D-c, 2G/N-3): `expRowC` is paid at every vertex of the
carrier whether the mask keeps it or not, so a chain of `2·cap`
expansions costs `Θ(cap·n)` per cluster even when the ball is three
vertices. 2G/N-3 said the repair is "expand a list of marked vertices
rather than the carrier"; the list is the turn's member list, and this
is that pass.

The inner block scan is **unchanged** — `ExpandSynth.expScan` and its
`expScan_le` are consumed, not re-proved. What is new is the outer loop,
its two-currency energy (B4c/D-d) and the two clauses of B4c/D-b. -/

/-! ### 4.1 `edges(block)` — the second currency

The carrier pass's slot budget is `off[n] - off[z]`, which telescopes
because the loop counter *is* the vertex. A block-driven loop's vertices
are `idx[p]`, in whatever order the cover wrote them, so the budget is a
**sum** and the telescoping is replaced by
`Finset.sum_eq_sum_Ico_succ_bot`. -/

`ExpandSynth.expOf_eq_expandVal` is the whole graph mathematics and is
consumed. What comes out is the block-driven pass in
`RamDriverDescend.expandCom_spec`'s language, at a cost that is the
block's and not the carrier's. -/

/-! ## 5. The costs, against the carrier passes

Every number below is exact on both sides: `ClusterSynth` and
`ExpandSynth` prove the carrier passes at closed costs and §§2–4 prove
the block passes at closed costs. The comparison is therefore arithmetic
and not estimation.

| pass | carrier (tower) | block (here) | per cell |
|---|---|---|---|
| clear + load | `12·n + 15·m + 19` | `15·m₁ + 15·m + 30` | clear `+3` |
| and-pass | `22·n + 4` | `25·m + 4` | `+3` |
| sub-pass | `26·n + 4` | `29·m + 4` | `+3` |
| expansion | `47·n + 30·ns + 4` | `50·m + 30·d + 4` | `+3` |

**The per-cell excess is one `aget` at every pass and nothing else** —
the member read `z := xmm[p]` that a carrier pass does not need because
its counter already *is* the cell. That is the whole price of the
change, and it buys `n → m` in the first factor and `ns → d` in the
second: over a level with `k` centres, `Θ(n·k)` becomes `Θ(xp)` with
`xp` the cover's write pointer (the block sizes sum to it) and
`Θ(k·ns)` becomes `Θ(ns)` when the blocks are disjoint. -/

/-! ## 7. What a consumer can take from here, and what is owed

### The swap-points

Each leaf below replaces a named pass of `RamDriver.clusterCom` at a
stated precondition. The integration wave owns the swap; this file owns
the leaf.

* **`rowScat` at `v := 0`, then `rowScat` at `v := 1`** (`blockLoad0_le`)
  replaces `clusterLoad j` = `fillCom (cluName j) 0; Csr.loadRow; Csr.scan`
  (D2a+D2b+D2c). *Precondition*: the destination is `Supported` on the
  **previous turn's** block — `xoff[cps (k-1)] … xoff[cps (k-1) + 1]`.
  At the **first** turn of a level there is no previous block and the
  carrier fill is still needed once, which is exactly the one `O(n)`
  charge `[[touched-only-costs]]` allows (`TrailRecursion` §6.4). The
  entry store must own **two** constant cells, `"zero"` and `"one"`
  (B4c/D-e).
* **`bandPass`/`bsubPass`** (`bandPass_spec`, `bsubPass_spec`) replace
  D3, D9, C1 (`andCom`) and D8 (`subCom`). *Precondition*: the first
  source and the destination are `Supported` on the turn's block —
  `bmask_eq_carrier` is the proof that under it the answers agree at
  every carrier cell. For D3 (`andCom alv clu res`) the first source is
  the *alive* mask, which is **not** supported on the block, so the swap
  there needs the roles exchanged (`andCom` is commutative in its two
  sources at the value level; `ClusterSynth.andG` is `HMul.hMul`).
* **`bandSelfPass`/`bsubSelfPass`** replace D7d and D10. *Additional
  precondition*: the block is injective (B4c/D-c), which is
  `RamCover.CoverOut.block_inj`.
* **`bexpPass`** (`bexpPass_spec`, `bexpPass_expandVal`) replaces
  `expandCom msk src dst` inside `chainCom` (D6) and inside `pdCom`/
  `puCom` (C2, C3). *Precondition*: `dst` is `Supported` on the block
  and `msk` marks no vertex outside it — then the cells the pass does
  not write already hold `expandVal` (which is `src`'s own value at a
  dead vertex, `expandVal_of_dead`), so the carrier writes were
  redundant.

### 7.1 Debts, named

**B4c/N-1 — the composed clear+load is not synthesized.** `rowScat` is,
at a general `v`, and `blockLoad0` is its sequential composition with
`v := 0` and `v := 1`; the tool did not translate the composition inside
1 000 000 heartbeats (it timed out at ≈ 280 s), where the same shape
with a *fill* in front — `ClusterSynth.loadSynth` — translates in about
one second. The measurement is the wave's own datapoint and its reading
is 2G/M-a's: **two loops whose bounds are both computed by preceding
operations cost the tool much more than one**, at the same state width.
§2's gate composes the two halves in the *evaluator* instead, which
checks the value claim end to end but leaves the composed `Com`
unpinned. The two ways out are a higher budget and an `hnr_seq` by hand;
neither is this wave's.

**B4c/N-2 — `degSum ≤ ns` is not proved.** The expansion's second
currency is the block's own slot count, and what a level's Σ-interface
needs is that the blocks' slot counts sum to the arena. That is a
counting fact about `RamCover.CoverOut.block_inj` and `MassMath`'s
tiling, of exactly the shape `Refine.ArenaBlock.sum_blockSize_compacted_le`
already proves for the block *sizes*; it is `ArenaBlock`'s to extend and
this file's to consume. Without it `bexpK m d` is honest but not yet
summable.

**B4c/N-3 — the first turn of a level still pays a carrier fill.** The
clear is the previous block's, so the induction needs a base, and the
base is `OrderSynth.fillPass` at `n`, once per level rather than once
per centre. That turns `Θ(n·k)` into `Θ(n + xp)` and is the allowed
charge, but it is a charge, and the recurrence in `CostRecurrence` has
to carry it.

**B4c/N-4 — no `BRefine` coverage** (2F/N-5 and 2G/N-2 at these passes).
Every bound (`pend`, `jend`) is a runtime cell entering as an `ℕ`.

**B4c/N-5 — the mask passes' first source is not always block-supported.**
Named under the swap-points above; D3 is the site.

### 7.2 Telemetry

| item | number |
|---|---|
| passes derived here | 6 (`rowScat`, four mask passes, the expansion) + 1 composed |
| syntheses | 6, all at 1 000 000 heartbeats |
| `rowScatSynth` | ≈ 1 s |
| the four mask passes | ≈ 5 s together |
| `bexpSynth` (outer + inner, branch containing the loop) | ≈ 30 s |
| file wall clock, warm, `lake env lean` | 74 s |
| widest state | 2 components (every pass is `(array, pointer)`) |
| `#guard`s | 90 |
| `#guard_msgs` blocks (negative controls + axiom checks) | 15 |
| refuted authored statements | 1 (the self-reading passes at a repeated member — B4c/D-c; the hypothesis was found by running the twin, not by failing a proof) |
| sorries | 0 |
| axioms | `propext`, `Classical.choice`, `Quot.sound` only |

**B4c/M-a — the block-driven form costs the tool nothing.** Every pass
here translated at the same heartbeat budget as its carrier counterpart
and in the same order of wall clock, at the same state width, with one
instruction more in the body. The indirection — reading the loop's
subject out of an array instead of using the counter — is not a tool
event. What *is* a tool event is the composition of two computed-bound
loops (B4c/N-1). -/
