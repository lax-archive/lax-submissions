**The dead-row sweep, walked** — rebase B8, the machine half.

**Retired by wave R1.8-T3-flip (c2b).** `RamDriver.driverAux` no longer
contains this pass: the level's postcondition is `RamDriver.TableInvOn`
at `alive ∪ D`, so nothing asks for a row at a dead vertex the enclosing
turn did not kill, and the kills are written at kill time by
`RamDriver.killCom` (`Refine.KillPass`). The program text, the
obligation and this discharge stay in the tree as the record of what the
flip removed — a carrier walk per level, `sweepCost` below — and no
theorem downstream consumes them. `Refine.G2CostProbe.hKd_gap` and
`RamDriverRoot.levelAt`'s `hKd` are the vestigial cost slot.

`RamDriver.SweepImplements` is the obligation; this file discharges it.
There is almost no new walk in it: `RamDriver.sweepCom` *is* the vertex
loop of the base case, factored out of `RamDriver.baseCom` and run at a
level's own depth instead of at the bottom, so `RamDriverBot.base_turn_spec`
is its turn verbatim and `Spec.forRangeZero` is its loop. What is new is
two lines of mathematics and one frame.

# §1 The mathematics: two readings of a dead vertex's row

`RamDriverBot.BaseTabOk` says the cells hold the truth values on the
**edgeless** arena. `RamDriver.TableInv` asks for the truth values on
the level's own arena `masked G M`. At a vertex the mask kills, those
are the same question — `Refine.DeadRow.sat_bot_of_dead` — and at a
vertex it does not kill they are different questions, which is why the
sweep's postcondition is quantified over the dead vertices only and why
the alive vertices' cells, which the sweep also writes, are left
uncharacterized: their own turn overwrites them.

# §2 The frame

The pass sits *between* the cover phase and the centre loop, so
everything the cover phase produced has to survive it. What it writes is
the depth's own tables and the generated evaluator's scratch —
`RamDriverBot.warrs_baseFold`/`wvars_baseFold`, read through the two
frame lemmas below — and every name a level holds is a depth-family name
whose first character is not `b`, hence not an extension of `"bb"`, and
is not a `tabName`. So the whole frame is character arithmetic on names.

# §3 Cost, and what it costs the recursion

`sweepCost` is one carrier-width walk whose turn is the depth's own
straight line of `botCom` fragments. From R1.8-T4a until R1.8-T4b it was
`RamDriverBot.baseCost` on the nose, the base case having shed the
representative pass and being literally this walk; T4b then gave the base
a member header, and what is left of the identity is
`sweepCost_le_baseCost`. It joins `Ko` and `Kc` as a **phase constant of a
level read at the arena's size**, which is the same debt the ordering
and cover phases already carry (`RamDriverRoot.levelAt`'s `hKo`/`hKc`
instantiate size-blind carrier-width constants at every size) and the
same debt the touched-only revision R1.6 owns. It is emphatically *not*
the debt B3 removed: that one was `n` **turns**, each opening a whole
nested driver; this is `n` **cells**, each a straight line of fixed
length. The arithmetic is `#guard`ed below.

Note the sweep is deliberately **not** guarded on aliveness. A guard
would save the alive vertices' fragments, but the alive vertices are the
minority of a nested arena — the dead ones are `n - m` of `n` — so the
guard buys a constant factor at best and costs a mask read per vertex.
The guard that matters is the one on the *turns*, and that one is in
`RamDriver.compactCom`.

The evaluator writes the cell `"bb"` and its extensions, the counter
`"z"`, the environment slots, and the depth's tables. Every name a level
holds is a depth-family name whose first character is not `b`, so none of
them is an extension of `"bb"`; and none of them is a `tabName`. -/

names, and `Refine.GapsDesign` §1.8 flagged that identity as the trap of
the closing wave — an edit to `RamDriver.sweepCom` would have moved the
retired pass with it and broken `sweepImplements` below.

The header moved on `RamDriver.baseCom` alone, so what is left of the
identity is this inequality: read at the *same* size the member walk pays
three more per turn than the carrier walk, that being the load of the
member out of the list. It is stated so the direction of the trade is
compiled and not asserted — the wave bought a smaller size (the arena,
`RamDriver.MemEnum.card_le_arenaSize`) at three per entry, and it is the

/-! ### §4 Falsification: the budget arithmetic

What the dead-vertex path costs a level, checked on numbers before it was
argued in prose. The sweep is `a · n + b` — a *cell* per vertex, not a
turn — and it enters the level's phase block as one more summand beside
`Ko` and `Kc`, with no factor anywhere. The last two checks are the
negative controls: a turn-shaped charge on the same carrier is orders
larger, and a per-turn sweep (one sweep inside every turn, the shape this
design deliberately avoids) is quadratic. -/

/-! ### §4b The member-list header, refuted (finding R1.8/1)

Wave R1.8 asked for this pass's loop header — and the base case's, since
`RamDriver.baseCom` *is* this `Com` at depth `ℓ` (R1.8-T4a; before it,
`reprCom` followed by this `Com`) — to walk the depth's member list
`RamDriver.memName j` instead of
the carrier, so that the charge becomes
`Refine.G2CostProbe.sweepCoeffA · (w + 1)` at the arena's weight. **The
header cannot move, and the obstruction is not a cost accident: it is
this pass's entire purpose.**

`RamDriver.MemEnum` (`LevelPre`'s sixteenth clause) enumerates
`{a < n | M a ≠ 0}` — the **alive** set. `RamDriver.DeadRows` — the
whole of `SweepImplements`' output clause, discharged above — is
quantified over `M v = 0`, the **dead** set. The two index sets are
exact complements (`notMem_markSet_of_dead`), so a member-list header
visits precisely the vertices whose rows this pass is *not* responsible
for (their own turns overwrite them, §1) and none of the vertices whose
rows it is. The same stop covers the base half twice over:

* `RamDriver.BaseImplements` asks for `RamDriver.TableInv` at depth `ℓ`,
  which is quantified over **all** of `Fin n`, dead vertices included;
* `BotEval.sat_exU_bot_of_repr`'s hypothesis `hW` — what `reprCom` was
  built to supply — asks for a same-row representative of every
  `v : Fin n` off the tuple, again dead ones included, because the
  bottom formula's *unrestricted* quantifier ranges over the carrier and
  not over the arena. (R1.8-T4a: this second reading is now moot for the
  landed surface — no tabled formula has an unrestricted quantifier
  (`Refine.DeadRowProbe.tabled_isLocal`), so the scan and its `hW` story
  left the program. The first reading, `TableInv` over all of `Fin n`,
  is the one the R1.8 design answers, by re-domaining the obligation.)

The witness below is the extreme case and the negative control: at the
all-dead mask the member list is **empty** at every carrier size, while
the pass owes a row at every one of the `n` vertices. No coefficient
read at the member count pays that walk — `no_memCoeff_pays_deadRows` —
which is `Refine.G2CostProbe.hKd_gap` again, but located at the
*obligation* rather than at the landed cost function, and therefore not
repairable by re-deriving a charge.

Re-charging the dead rows is consequently a **program** change and not
a header change. The recorded design intent is that a vertex's
death-row write charges to the turn that killed it — its block contains
it — which moves the write out of this pass and into the centre loop's
turn; that is the turn re-thread's wave, and no charging scheme is
invented here. -/
