# ND-MC rebase P2 / satellite 2F — the DESCEND/CLUSTER leaves at `R = 0`,
re-derived through the refinement tower

`RamDriver.clusterCom q_top cap mb φ j inner` is one turn of the driver's
loop over the centres of a level's cover: the descent into a cluster, the
padded enumeration of the round's batch, the colouring of the next depth,
the nested driver, the scatter atoms, and the readback. This file maps it
pass by pass and re-derives its **leaf passes** through the tower.

## 0. THE REDUCTION — what `clusterCom q_top cap mb φ j inner` actually
runs

Two facts govern the map, and neither is the one the ordering phase's
map turned on.

**`clusterCom` does not mention `R`.** Unlike `RamDriver.orderCom`,
whose augmentation fold collapses to `Com.skip` at `R = 0` and takes
three counting sorts with it (`OrderSynth` §0), the cluster step is
*`R`-independent*: every pass below is live at `R = 0` exactly as it is
at `R > 0`. So there is no degeneracy to harvest here, and the map is
the full program.

**What does degenerate is the depth.** The recorded-batch fold
`foldRange (fun a => ancestorStep cap j a) j` of `RamDriver.batchCom`
runs `j` turns, so **at the top depth `j = 0` it is `Com.skip`** — no
`RamBfsPaths.bfsParCom`, no `extractPathCom`, no `markPath`, and the
batch of the round is the connector alone cut down to the ball. The
whole game side of the descent — the only place a search is called from
inside a cluster — first appears at `j = 1`. That is this map's
counterpart of 2E's `Com.skip` finding, and it is why the leaves below
are ordered as they are: `scatPass` (§3) is reached at every depth,
`markPath` only from `j = 1`.

### The six phases

| # | phase | shape |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `descendCom cap j` | **D1–D10 below** |
| 2 | `enumBatch (batName j) mb` | two flat loops (compaction + padding) |
| 3 | `colourCom cap mb j` | **C1–C3 below** |
| 4 | `inner` | the nested driver — **RETAINED** (pinned boundary) |
| 5 | `foldIdx (scatterCom …) 0 (tablesAt …)` | per atom: two prefix copies + the scatter **engine** |
| 6 | `readbackCom q_top cap mb φ j` | one flat loop, straight-line body |

### The descent, pass by pass

| # | command | shape | this file |
|---|---|---|---|
| D1 | `.assign (ctrName j) (.get (ordName j) (.var (curName j)))` | one `aget` | — |
| D2a | `fillCom (cluName j) (.lit 0)` | prefix fill at `n` | `OrderSynth.fillPass` |
| D2b | `Csr.loadRow (xofName j) (curName j) "p" "pend"` | two machine ops, **three** IR ops (2F/D-b) | §6 |
| D2c | `Csr.scan "p" "pend" (…)` | **the touched-only scatter loop** | **§3 `scatPass`** |
| D3 | `andCom (alvName j) (cluName j) (resName j)` | prefix mask pass | **§4 `andPass`** |
| D4 | `fillCom (balName j) (.lit 0)` | prefix fill at `n` | `OrderSynth.fillPass` |
| D5 | `.store (balName j) (.var (ctrName j)) (.lit 1)` | one `aset` | — |
| D6 | `chainCom (gamName j) (ballStage j) (2 * cap)` | `2·cap` × **`expandCom`** — a *nested* loop | **not derived (§9 debt 1)** |
| D7a | `fillCom (batName j) (.lit 0)` | prefix fill at `n` | `OrderSynth.fillPass` |
| D7b | `.store (batName j) (.var (ctrName j)) (.lit 1)` | one `aset` | — |
| D7c | `foldRange (ancestorStep cap j ·) j` | `j` turns; **`Com.skip` at `j = 0`** | see below |
| D7d | `andCom (batName j) (balName j) (batName j)` | **self-reading** mask pass | **§5 `andSelfPass`** |
| D8 | `subCom (resName j) (batName j) (alvName (j+1))` | prefix mask pass | **§4 `subPass`** |
| D9 | `andCom (gamName j) (balName j) (gamName (j+1))` | prefix mask pass | **§4 `andPass`** |
| D10 | `subCom (gamName (j+1)) (batName j) (gamName (j+1))` | **self-reading** mask pass | **§5 `subSelfPass`** |

and one turn `ancestorStep cap j a` of D7c is

| # | command | shape | this file |
|---|---|---|---|
| A1 | `.assign "src" (.var (ctrName a))`, `.assign "tv" (.var (ctrName j))` | two copies | — |
| A2 | `copyCom (gamName a) "alv"` | prefix copy at `n` | `OrderSynth.copyPass` |
| A3 | `RamBfsPaths.bfsParCom (2 * cap)` | the **search engine** (leaf) | consumed, §9 debt 2 |
| A4 | `.ite (dist[tv] < 2·cap+1) (extractPathCom; markPath (batName j)) .skip` | guarded walk-back + **the path marker** | **§3 `scatPass` again** |

### The colouring, pass by pass

| # | command | shape | this file |
|---|---|---|---|
| C1 | `oldCom cap mb j` | `sigL` × `andCom` + one `copyCom` | **§4 `andPass`**, `OrderSynth.copyPass` |
| C2 | `pdCom cap mb j` | `mb` × (prefix fill + one `aset` + `chainCom … cap`) | fill derived; chain = debt 1 |
| C3 | `puCom cap mb j` | `(sigL+1)` × (prefix copy + `chainCom … cap`) | copy derived; chain = debt 1 |

### So what is a leaf here, and what is not

Counting instances at depth `j` with `s := sigL cap mb j`:

* **prefix passes over the carrier** — `4 + j` copies (D2a…, A2, C1, C3) and
  `3 + mb` fills, plus `2 + s` and-passes, `1` sub-pass, `1` self-and,
  `1` self-sub. Every one of them is `RamDriver.fillUpto` with a cell
  expression, and §§3–5 derive the three cell expressions the phase uses
  that `OrderSynth` did not: the **indirect store** (D2c/A4), the
  **product of two masks** (D3/D9/C1), and the **product with a
  complement** (D8).
* **touched-only passes** — exactly one: D2c, the `Csr.scan` of the
  cluster load, whose turns are the *members of the block* and not the
  carrier. §8 is what that is worth and what it is not worth.
* **nested loops** — `expandCom` only, at `2·cap + mb·cap + (s+1)·cap`
  instances per cluster. This is the single largest underived object on
  the `C0` path and §9 debt 1 states it precisely.
* **engines called as leaves** — the search (A3) and the scatter
  (phase 5). Both are already through the tower (`BfsBridge`,
  `ScatterSynth.scatterTowerCom_spec`); nothing here re-derives them.
* **retained** — `inner`, and every per-depth name (`curName j`,
  `cluName j`, …). The leaves below take their cells at *one* depth, as
  literals; the driver's name generation is the pinned boundary and
  stays out of this file.

## 2F/D-a — the cluster load's two halves are charged differently

`clusterLoad j` is `fillCom (cluName j) 0` *then* the block scan. The
scan is touched-only — its cost is `15·|block(c)| + 4`, the block's own
size — but the fill that precedes it is `12·n + 4` **per cluster**, so
the pass as a whole is `Θ(n)` per cluster and `Θ(n · #clusters)` per
level. §8 states both halves separately and §8's `clusterLoadK` is the
sum; this is `[[touched-only-costs]]` at its named site, and the
touched-only *shape* is visible in `scatPass_spec`'s bound (`e - p₀`,
never `n`) while the `Θ(n)` is visible in `clusterLoadK`. Recording it
here rather than repairing it: the repair is a change to the *machine*
program (a trail array over the previous block, `Examples/TrailRecursion`'s
carrier-free idiom), which this satellite does not own.

## 2F/D-b — the row load is three IR operations, not two

`Csr.loadRow o v j jend` is `j := o[v]; jend := o[v+1]`, two machine
instructions with an addition nested inside the second's index. The IR
has no nested operand (2E/D-b at a second site), so the tower's load is
`aget p o cur; add t cur one; aget pend o t` — one extra cell and one
extra time unit per *row*, which is once per cluster and not once per
member. §6 pins it.

## 2F/D-c — the self-reading mask passes are different programs

`andCom (batName j) (balName j) (batName j)` and
`subCom (gamName (j+1)) (batName j) (gamName (j+1))` read their own
destination. At the machine layer that is invisible — array names are
strings and `RamDriverDescend.andSelfCom_spec` is a separate lemma for
exactly this reason. At the tower it is *not* invisible: the destination
array is the loop state's own component and the source is a frame
conjunct, and one cell name cannot be both. So §5 derives them as their
own abstract programs, reading `s.1` where §4 reads the frame — the
values agree because each cell reads only its own index, which is
`binI`'s last conjunct and is the content of §5's two `_le` lemmas.

## 2F/D-d — the stored constant rides in a cell

`Csr.scan`'s body stores `.lit 1` and `subCom`'s expression contains
`.lit 1`. The IR's `aset` takes three cells and its `binop` takes two,
so both literals are cells: `"sv"` for the scatter pass's value and the
entry store's pinned `"one"` for the complement. This is
`OrderSynth.fillPass`'s `"flv"` at two more sites, and it is why §3's
pass is stated at a *general* `v` and instantiated at `1`.

## What is consumed rather than re-proved

`OrderSynth.copyPass`/`fillPass` are this campaign's own capital and are
used, not restated: D2a, D4, D7a, A2, C1's copy and C3's copy are them.
`ElimSynth2`'s two devices (`while_pot_le`, `larr`) carry every loop
below. `SplitterWinRec` is not touched at all — the game mathematics of
the batch is `RamDriverDescend`'s and this file owes it nothing.

## House traps observed

`omega` is blind through `Ir.Val`, so every arithmetic obligation is
bound at `ℕ` first; `decide +kernel` for the cost numerals; never
`simp [Codegen.embed]`; junk cells are consumed in written order across
leaf boundaries (2E/D-d), so composed programs are pinned from the
tool's own report and never by hand-seq; loop states are assembled with
`mopPair` and never as literal tuples (P4/D-m).

/-! ## 1. Refute before prove

The three cell expressions of §§3–5 as computable functions, run to
their ends, and their answers pinned — first against hand-computed
readings on a small arena, then (in §7) against `Ir.evalFuel`'s reading
of the *synthesized* programs.

The hot spots, and where each is checked:

* **the block scan is indirect** — it writes at `xmem[p]`, not at `p`.
  A pass that wrote at `p` would agree with this one exactly when the
  block is an identity segment, and the arena below's second block is
  not. The negative control exhibits it.
* **the block scan is a prefix of a prefix** — it starts at `xoff[c]`
  and stops at `xoff[c+1]`, so it touches neither the earlier blocks'
  members nor the later ones'. Both ends are checked.
* **the cluster load aliases its own fill** — `clusterLoad` is the fill
  of the *whole carrier* followed by the scan of *one block*, so the
  cells the scan does not reach are the fill's zeroes and not the
  caller's. The composed twin is checked against a carrier longer than
  the block.
* **`andCom` and `subCom` are not each other**, and the self-reading
  versions are not the frame-reading ones on a source that has already
  been overwritten. Both are checked.
* **`subCom` needs its second argument to be a mask.** `a * (1 - b)` on
  a `b` above `1` is truncated to `a * 0 = 0`, which is the complement's
  answer, but on a `b` of `2` a reading that expected `a - b` would
  differ. The negative control fixes which one the program is.

/-! ## 2. The block scan — the one touched-only pass of the descent

`Csr.scan "p" "pend"` over `.store (cluName j) (.get (xmmName j) (.var
"p")) (.lit 1)`: read the member at the slot pointer, mark it, bump the
pointer. Its turns are the **members of the block** — the loop starts at
`xoff[c]` and stops at `xoff[c+1]` — so its cost is the block's size and
not the carrier's, which is the whole of D2c's claim and what §8 cashes.

The specification is stated *positively and negatively*: every slot of
the block is marked, and every cell no slot of the block names is the
entry array's. The second half is what the fill in front of it turns
into "and everything else is zero" (§6), and it is what
`RamDriverCluster.BatchData`'s `markSet n Xa = X` needs. -/

/-! ## 3. The mask passes, generically

`RamDriver.andCom a b dst` and `subCom a b dst` are both
`fillUpto dst (.var "n") e` with a two-array cell expression, and so is
`oldCom`'s pass. What differs between them is the expression and the
price; what does not is the loop. So the loop is proved once here, at an
abstract body and an abstract cell function, and §§4–5 supply four
bodies.

The invariant is `OrderSynth.copyI`'s with the source read through the
cell function — deliberately, because the frame conditions
`RamDriverCluster.BatchData` and `TurnPre` need the destination cell by
cell below the bound *and* above it. -/

/-! ## 6. The five passes, synthesized

Cell names are literals here, as the tool requires, and they are *not*
the driver's per-depth names: at depth `j` the scan's `"clu"` is
`RamDriver.cluName j` and its `"xmm"` is `xmmName j`, and at A4 the same
program runs at `"bat"`/`"path"`. The renaming is the integration wave's
(§10), and the leaves are stated at one depth exactly as the pinned
boundary decision says. -/

/-! ## 8. `clusterLoad`, composed — the pass the touched-only question is
about

D2a, D2b and D2c in one program: the fill of the carrier, the two offset
reads that bound the block, and the scan of the block. This is
`RamDriver.clusterLoad j` entire, and it is the composition the wave was
for, because it is where the `Θ(n)` half and the touched-only half meet.

Two tool facts it exercises, neither of which the ordering phase needed:
a loop whose **bound and start counter are both computed by preceding
operations** (R2D/D-b's shape, at a loop the tool synthesizes itself
rather than at a registered leaf), and a **bound-tuple split followed by
a re-pair** — the fill delivers `(array, counter)`, the scan wants
`(array, pointer)`, and the counter is dropped. -/

/-! ## 10. The costs, against the hand-walked passes

Unlike the ordering phase's, the descent's baseline numbers are not a
budget: `Lax3Proofs.RamDriverCluster` proves each flat pass at an exact
cost, and `RamDriverDescend.clusterLoad_spec` proves the load at one. So
the comparison is exact on both sides.

| pass | hand-walked | tower | per cell |
|---|---|---|---|
| `fillCom_spec` | `11·N + 6` | `12·N + 4` | `+1` |
| `copyCom_spec` | `12·N + 6` | `15·N + 4` | `+3` |
| `andCom_spec` | `15·N + 6` | `22·N + 4` | `+7` |
| `subCom_spec` | `17·N + 6` | `26·N + 4` | `+9` |
| `andSelfCom_spec` | `15·N + 6` | `22·N + 4` | `+7` |
| `clusterLoad_spec` | `11·n + 24·m + 26` | `12·n + 15·m + 19` | **see below** |

The per-cell excess is the same deviation everywhere and it is not a
regression in the algorithm: the machine's cell expression is *one*
instruction priced by its syntactic size, and the IR has no nested
operand, so a cell expression of `k` reads becomes `k` `aget`s plus one
operation per connective. `andCom`'s `+7` is exactly one `aget` (`3`)
and one `mul` (`4`); `subCom`'s `+9` is those and the `sub`'s
truncation minus the two units the machine's constant folding of `.lit
1` saves. Every one of the six is accounted for by 2E/D-b's rule, and
none by a change of algorithm.

**The load is now block-priced on both sides.** The hand walk consumes the
`CluScan` lower endpoint and costs `11·n + 24·m + 26`, where `m` is the
selected block's size. Its larger per-block coefficient includes the child
member-list emission that this older tower model does not perform. Summed
over the centres of one level, both readings have shape

    Θ(n·k) + Θ(xp)   with k the number of centres,

because the block sizes sum to the cover's write pointer. The remaining
carrier term is the indicator clear, once per centre (2F/D-a). -/

/-! ## 11. What `ClusterStepImplements` asks for, and what is here

`RamDriverCluster.DescendStep` is the obligation D1–D10 discharge
together. This file does **not** discharge it: it derives six of its
passes and leaves `expandCom`, the search leaf and the padding to the
integration wave. What a consumer can take from here today is

* `scatPass_spec` — D2c and A4, at a bound that is the block's size;
* `andPass_spec`, `subPass_spec` — D3, D8, D9, C1;
* `andSelfPass_spec`, `subSelfPass_spec` — D7d, D10 (2F/D-c);
* `clusterLoad0_le` + `loadSynth` — D2a+D2b+D2c as one program, with
  its cost and both halves of `BatchData`'s indicator condition;
* the five synthesized programs, pinned instruction for instruction.

The postconditions are stated in `List`/`[·]!` terms and not in
`arrOf`/`markSet` terms. Turning `∀ q, xoff[c]! ≤ q → q < xoff[c+1]! →
t.1[idx[q]!]! = 1` into `markSet n Xa = {v | InCluster …}` is
`RamDriverDescend.clusterLoad_spec`'s second half and is *mathematics
already landed* — it is consumed by the integration wave, not re-proved
here (the same discipline `OrderSynth` §11 states for `OrdersBy`).

## 12. Debts, named

**2F/N-1 — `expandCom`, the nested expansion, is not derived.** It is
the only underived *shape* left on the `C0` path after this wave: an
outer loop over the carrier whose body branches on the mask and, in the
true arm, loads a CSR row and runs an inner scan with a hit flag. Per
cluster the descent runs it `2·cap` times (D6) and the colouring
`mb·cap + (sigL+1)·cap` times (C2, C3). This is **not** a matcher gap:
`ElimSynth3.elimLoop` is the same shape at a wider state and it
translates, so what stands between here and there is budget, estimated
at 400–600 lines and one wide-state synthesis (≈ 90 s at eleven
components; this one has six).

**2F/N-2 — `enumBatch` needs a deviation, and the deviation needs a
refutation first.** The compaction loop writes `wa` *and* bumps `bc`
under a branch, and both arms of an `irIf` must deliver the same
destination (2B′/D-b). `CoverSynth.emitF`'s idiom — write
unconditionally, let the branch decide only the value — does not apply
unchanged, because here it is the *index* that is conditional. The
shape that does work is `wa[bc] := z` unconditionally together with
`bc := bc + bat[z]`: a non-hit writes a cell that the next hit, or the
padding loop, overwrites. Its answer is the machine's **provided the
batch indicator is `0`/`1`** — §1's negative control on `subG` is the
same hypothesis at a different site — and the padding loop's first
write is at `bc`, which is what closes the argument. Nothing of this is
proved here; it is a proposal with its refutation obligation attached.

**2F/N-3 — the readback may not be a tower leaf at all.** `readbackCom`'s
body is a straight line of `|tablesAt …|` stores whose values are
`bcExpr` of a *formula-indexed* boolean combination — program text
generated by recursion on a construction-time object, exactly like
`botCom`. The pinned boundary decision retains name-generating
recursion; the readback is the first pass on the `C0` path where it is
not obvious which side of that line it falls on. The integration wave
should decide it before anyone budgets for it.

**2F/N-4 — the guarded engine call (A4) is untried.** `ancestorStep`
wraps `extractPathCom; markPath` in an `.ite` on a scalar. An `irIf`
whose arm *contains a registered leaf* is a shape the tower has not been
asked for; `markPath` itself is derived here (it is `scatPass`), so what
is untried is only the guard around it.

**2F/N-5 — no `BRefine` coverage.** None of the five passes carries a
bounded-word refinement: every bound (`n`, `pend`, `mb`) is a runtime
cell and enters as an `ℕ`. `ScatterSynth` §15's `ScanBounded` pattern
applies to the two-level passes, and the flat ones would pay the
≈ 50-line tax each. Deferred, deliberately: the wave's budget went to
the reduction map and to the load.
