**The kill list, measured** — wave R1.8-T3-flip, scopes (a) and (a2).

`RamDriver.killListCom` is the program: the turn's kill set, enumerated
**once each** into `klName j` and counted into `kkName j`, by the same
guarded walk of the padded batch buffer as `RamDriver.killCom`, with a
membership scan of the already-emitted prefix as the dedupe.
`Refine.KillListWalk` proves its walk; **this** file is the measured
half — the compiled refutation that the dedupe is load-bearing, the
measured clock, the moved absorption constant `ctKL`, and the Σ closure
re-run at it.

**Why the halves are two files.** `RamDriverRoot` has to read the walk —
`RamDriverRoot.killListStep` is the discharge of
`RamDriverCluster.KillListStep`, and the turn's charge is a summand of
`RamDriverRoot.turnCost` — while re-running the Σ closure needs
`Refine.G2ExistsRevalidation`, which imports the driver's root. So the
walk sits above the driver (`Refine.KillListWalk`, importing only
`Refine.KillPass`) and the probes sit below it, exactly as
`Refine.KillPass` sits above and `Refine.DeadRowProbe` below for the kill
pass. Both halves are the one namespace `Lax3Proofs.Refine.KillListPass`.

# Why a list, and why the dedupe is load-bearing

The atom pass's kill walk
(`Refine.ScatterDeadFold.sum_bit_eq_ncard_inter`) sums child-table bits
over an enumeration of the kill set, and its `hinj` hypothesis is
repetition-freeness: a repeated entry counts a kill twice. The buffer
cannot serve directly — the padding repeats its first entry, and
`RamDriverCluster.ClusterWa` pins only the buffer's *range* — and
strengthening the landed padding would move `EnumStep`'s postcondition.
§0 compiles both halves of that: the deduped walk reports the kill set's
size, and the same walk with the scan dropped emits a duplicate.

# Cost

`killListCost mb = (20·mb + 64)·mb + 8`: **carrier-blind** — `n` does
not occur — and quadratic in the buffer's width `mb`, the formula-sized
`ℓ · (2·cap + 1)`, which is the design's accepted `O(mb²)` dedupe class
(§6 (a)). The charge rides the turn's own size slot as the kill pass's
does (F-4); §0 measures the instance and pins the moved absorption
constant in both directions, and the Σ interface closes at the moved
constant (`killList_interface_closes`) — the closure is indifferent,
which is F-4's disposition.

The instrument is `TgtWidenProbe.execC`, as in `Refine.DeadRowProbe` §5.
The arena: a three-entry buffer `7, 91, 7` — the padding's repeated
first entry — with both vertices alive and in the cluster. -/

kill list's charge cannot ride under the same constant: `ct` moves, by
exactly the measured instance. Both directions are pinned below, and
`killList_interface_closes` is the Σ interface at the moved constant —
indifferent, which is design §7's F-4 disposition. -/

`Refine.DeadRowProbe.deadRow_interface_closes` at `ct = ctKL` in place
of `284`, same live slots otherwise: the closure is indifferent to the turn
coefficient's value (F-4), so absorbing the kill list moves a number
and no interface. -/
