**G2-design: the arena-charged phase interface, compiled in both
directions** (plan rev 3, G-road; design doc
`plans/nowhere-dense-model-checking/g2-cost-design.md`).

`C0Probe.level_interface_floor` proved that the LANDED side conditions
`hKo`/`hKc`/`hKd`/`hKbase` of `RamDriverRoot.driverRoot_decides_sentence`
admit no level budget below `n·(60·W + 1600·n)`, and `60·n³` on the C0
width path. This file is the design gate for the repair, under the
standing rule that prose verdicts do not gate work: every proposed form
is stated here as a local `def`, an **existence probe** proves the
`CostRecurrence` witness satisfies every proposed form and closes to the
`(D+1)^ℓ` recurrence, the **floor-death** theorems prove the C0Probe
derivation routes are cut against the proposed forms, and the
**honesty controls** tie the proposed coefficients to the landed engine
exports (with negative controls showing undersized budgets fail).

Nothing here edits the frozen surface. The proposed forms move to the
real declarations only in G2 execution, per the design doc's wave
decomposition.

# The design, in one paragraph

One size variable threads the whole interface: the **arena weight**
`w` — alive vertices plus their degree sum in the level's graph (at the
root, `w = n + ns`). Every phase budget becomes `coeff · (w + 1)`; block
budgets read block weights; the mass side condition keeps its landed
Σ-shape verbatim (block weights sum to `≤ D · (w + 1)` by the same
per-vertex cover-degree bound `hdeg` that today bounds vertex mass).
The ordering phase's coefficient carries `bsq = (budget d D₁ R + 1)²`:
one save/restore of the **live width** `m·bsq + e + 1` per level entry,
and the `R` augment/relink rounds, all charged at the arena. The width
itself is repaired to `chainWidthE = n·bsq + ns + 1` — the `n·n` term
of `TgtCoupling.chainWidth` (there to hold the level's own graph at a
generic `ns ≤ n²`) dies against the actual slot count `ns`. The program
text loses its four `.lit W` sites (`saveCsr`/`restoreCsr`/
`augRelinkCom`/`orderCom`'s in-list copy) to a runtime live-width
scalar, making the com family `W`-free — the C0 quantifier order
(`∃ p, ∀ n G w`) forbids any input-scaling literal in the text, and
`orderCom_reads_W` below compiles the fact that today's text violates
this.

/-! ### §1 The proposed width (design item ii-a)

`TgtCoupling.chainWidth n d D₁ r = n·(budget+1)² + n·n + 1`; the `n·n`
holds the level's own graph via `csrSlots_le_sq`. The repair: the
level's graph occupies exactly `ns` slots, and every masked sub-arena's
graph at most that, so the width is `ns`-aware and the `n·n` dies. Both
"fits" lemmas of the old width re-prove against the new one at the
hypotheses their consumers actually have. -/

/-- The chain-slot coefficient: the square the augmentation budget
forces on the per-vertex row width. Constant in `n` (it is a function
of `d`, `D₁`, `R` only — at the C0 path `d = ⌈c·n^δ⌉` makes it
subpolynomial, which is P4's real-exponent massage, not this file's). -/

/-- Degree-aware replacement for `TgtCoupling.chainWidth`: room for
every round's fraternity graph (`n·(b+1)²`, unchanged) and for the
level's own graph at its actual slot count `ns` — not at the generic
`n·n`.

**GRADUATED (rebase G2/E2)**: the real declaration is
`TgtCoupling.chainWidthE`, with the fits lemmas and the
`chainWidthE_dominates` reading beside it, and
`RamDriverCompose.orderImplementsR`'s `hWc` reads it. The local name
delegates so this file's compiled record reads unchanged. -/

/-! ### §2 The proposed phase forms (design item i)

Each landed slot `phaseCost ≤ K j m` (carrier-read, arena-blind)
becomes `phaseCostA ≤ K j w` with `phaseCostA = coeff · (w + 1)` read
at the arena weight. The coefficients are not free-floating: §5's
honesty controls tie each to the landed export that will discharge it
(or to the named block-driven re-derivation of the design doc's wave
decomposition). -/

/-- **PROPOSED** `hKo` form: the ordering phase charged at the arena.
`2310` covers the two eliminations, the symmetrization and the
carrier-linear part of `orderPhaseCost` (honesty:
`orderPhaseCostR_le_orderCostA`); the `bsq` factor is the ONE
save/restore of the live prefix per level entry plus the in-list copy;
`16840` per round covers `augCost + relinkCost + 650·W` at the live
width. -/
def orderCostA (b R w : ℕ) : ℕ := (2310 + 16840 * R) * b * (w + 1)

/-- **PROPOSED** `hKd` form coefficient: the dead-row sweep walks the
arena's member list instead of the carrier; per member it pays exactly
the landed per-vertex turn cost. -/
noncomputable def sweepCoeffA (q_top cap mb jd : ℕ) (φ : Lax3.FirstOrder.FO 0) : ℕ :=
  RamDriverBot.turnCost q_top cap mb jd φ + 10

/-- **PROPOSED** `hKbase` form coefficient: the base pass (the depth's
table fold) walks the member list.

**R1.8-T4a.** The coefficient used to open with
`RamDriverBot.reprBodyCost ℓ (sigL cap mb ℓ)` — the representative
scan's per-vertex turn, an inner loop over the whole row space. The scan
is out of the program (`RamDriver.baseCom`; the shed is
`Refine.BaseShed`), so the term drops from the discharge and what is
left is the fold's own per-vertex charge. The base pass's charge is now
within `12` per member of the dead sweep's (`sweepCoeffA`), which is
right: since the shed the two passes are the same `Com`
(`Refine.DeadSweep.sweepCost_le_baseCost`; before R1.8-T4b they were the
same `Com` and the same charge). -/
noncomputable def baseCoeffA (q_top cap mb ℓ : ℕ) (φ : Lax3.FirstOrder.FO 0) : ℕ :=
  RamDriverBot.turnCost q_top cap mb ℓ φ + 22

/-- **PROPOSED** replacement for `RamDriverRoot.turnCostSize`: the size
slot is READ (today it is discarded — `turnCostSize_eq` is `rfl` to the
carrier-width `turnCost`). One turn on a block of weight `s` pays its
block-driven leaves and its scatter chain at `s`, plus the nested
driver once. -/

/-! ### §3 The existence probe (the §2.4 gap, closed compiled)

`integration-design.md` §2.4 asserted in prose that the Σ interface
yields `n^{1+ε}`; the assertion was wrong because the PHASE slots never
moved. This section is the compiled replacement: a witness family
satisfies every proposed side condition **verbatim** and closes to
`(ℓ·A + Cb)·(D+1)^ℓ·(w+1)`, with the root reads (decode + dedup,
sentence, prologue/allocation at `W = chainWidthE`) accounted. -/

/-- **The existence probe.** For every level count, mass coefficient,
round budget and per-phase coefficient family there are cost functions
satisfying, verbatim:

* the four **proposed** phase forms (the new `hKo`/`hKc`/`hKd`/`hKbase`
  — arena-charged, so `O(1)` on the empty arena);
* the landed Σ-interface shapes of `driverRoot_decides_sentence` —
  `hKmono`, `hKs` (at the proposed size-reading turn cost) and `hKl`
  byte for byte (`Kmass := D`);

with the root budget geometric in `D + 1` and linear in the weight.
The witness is `CostRecurrence`'s canonical solution; nothing is
bespoke. -/

`C0Probe.level_interface_floor`'s derivation had two loads: (1) `hKo`
charges `orderPhaseCost n ns W` on the EMPTY arena, so a nested level
is `Ω(n + W)` before it runs a turn; (2) `chainWidth` pins
`n·n ≤ W`. Both die. -/

/-- **Route 1 cut**: under the proposed form the empty-arena order
charge is a constant — `n` does not occur. (The witness `Ko` of
`g2_exists` meets the proposed slot with equality, so this is the
charge an admissible budget actually pays there.) -/
theorem emptyArena_charge_const (b R : ℕ) :
    orderCostA b R 0 = (2310 + 16840 * R) * b := by
  simp [orderCostA]

-- and the old floor's step-1 inequality is refuted at that budget:
-- `orderPhaseCost 10⁶ 0 0 = 1600·10⁶ + 650` does not fit under the
-- proposed empty-arena charge at `b = 1`, `R = 0`
#guard ¬ (RamDriverCompose.orderPhaseCost (10 ^ 6) 0 0 ≤ orderCostA 1 0 0)

/-- **The floor analogue is REFUTED.** `C0Probe.level_interface_floor`
proved from the LANDED forms that every admissible `Kl` pays
`n·(60·W + 1600·n)`. The same statement over the PROPOSED forms — with
the width slot at the repaired `chainWidthE` — is false: the
`g2_exists` witness satisfies every proposed side condition with a

/-! ### §5 Honesty controls (the proposed budgets still pay the real engines)

Per phase: the landed engine export at a NONEMPTY arena (the root
arena, `m = n`, `e = ns`, weight `w = n + ns` — the one arena where a
carrier-cost export is a block cost) fits the proposed budget at that
weight, with the constants tied. Plus the two compiled NEGATIVE
findings — the landed `coverPhaseCost` and `descendCost` carry `n²`
terms that fit NO weight-linear budget; those are program deltas of the
design doc (the coverSave member copy and the six descend carrier
fills), not interface slack. And per §4.3, a deliberately undersized
budget FAILS each check. -/

/-- **Order phase honest**: the full landed `R`-round phase cost —
eliminations, symmetrization, `R` rounds of `augCost + relinkCost +
650·W` — fits the proposed budget at the root weight, for every width
within the arena-linear bound. The constants `2310`/`16840` are read
off `orderPhaseCost`/`augCost`/`relinkCost` here, not chosen. -/

The landed cover-phase wrapper and the landed descend leaves carry
carrier-quadratic terms (`12·n²` — the coverSave member copy "charged
at the whole cluster arena", its own docstring's words — and `16·n²`,
the six flat fills). No weight-linear budget covers them: they are
PROGRAM deltas (design doc items E2/E3), and the honesty controls above
deliberately bound the engine parts only. -/

from each budget refutes the corresponding honesty control on data. -/

/-! ### §6 Text uniformity (design item iii — a correctness constraint)

C0 (`Lax3.ModelChecking`) fixes ONE program before `∀ n G w`: the final
text may contain no input-scaling literal. The sweep of
`RamDriver.lean`'s text constructors finds exactly one: `W`, at four
sites (`saveCsr`/`restoreCsr` and the two in-list `copyUpto`s of
`augRelinkCom`/`orderCom`); every loop bound is `.var`-driven
(`fillCom` reads `"n"`, the decode leaves `"n"`/`"m"` from the input).
The finding that the text read `W` was compiled here as
`saveCsr_reads_W`/`orderCom_reads_W` — two widths, two programs. **Wave
E1 has landed the repair** and those two statements are no longer
*statable*: `RamDriver.saveCsr` takes no width argument at all, so
`saveCsr 5 ≠ saveCsr 6` does not elaborate. Their tombstones below are
the positive form the repair makes available — uniformity *by
signature*, which is stronger than the inequality the findings refuted
and is what C0 actually consumes. The four copies now read the runtime
scalar `"lw"`, pinned to the allocation width by
`RamDriver.OrderMem`; the width survives only in the Props and in the
cost functions. -/

/-- **TOMBSTONE of `saveCsr_reads_W` (rebase G2/E1).** The finding was
`RamDriver.saveCsr 5 ≠ RamDriver.saveCsr 6`; it is now ill-typed, and
what replaces it is that the save is a single closed term of `Com` — no
width, no input, nothing to quantify over. The `rfl` is the content: the
elaborator accepts `RamDriver.saveCsr` at type `Com`, which is exactly
"one program". -/
theorem saveCsr_uniform : (RamDriver.saveCsr : Lax13Proofs.Imp.Com) = RamDriver.saveCsr := rfl

/-- **TOMBSTONE of `orderCom_reads_W` (rebase G2/E1).** The phase's text
is a function of the round count and the depth alone — both formula
parameters, neither input-scaling — so ONE `orderCom R j` serves every
`n`, `G` and `W`. Stated as the two projections the old finding
separated: the text at two different widths is now literally the same
term, because there is no width to differ in. -/
theorem orderCom_uniform (R j : ℕ) :
    RamDriver.orderCom R j = RamDriver.orderCom R j := rfl

/-- And the same at the root, which is the term C0 quantifies over:
`driverRoot q_top cap mb R ℓ φ` — the design's target parameter list,
`W`-free. -/
theorem driverRoot_uniform (q_top cap mb R ℓ : ℕ) (φ : Lax3.FirstOrder.FO 0) :
    RamDriver.driverRoot q_top cap mb R ℓ φ =
      RamDriver.driverRoot q_top cap mb R ℓ φ := rfl

/-- **The differential control.** The old finding's force was that the
save's *text* changed with the width. It does not any more, and the two
copies inside it are now driven by the scalar: at two different values
of `"lw"` the SAME text is one program that copies two different prefix
lengths. The `#guard` pair below runs it. -/
example : (RamDriver.saveCsr : Lax13Proofs.Imp.Com) = RamDriver.saveCsr := rfl

/-! ### §7 The E6 plug — what the witness family fits after the weight
re-thread, and the compiled per-slot gaps (rebase G2/E6)

E6 re-threaded the driver's Σ interface to the **arena weight**:

* `RamDriverCluster.levelImplements` reads its budgets at abstract
  arena/block measures (`wA`/`wB` — parameters, because
  `Refine.MassWeight` sits above the cluster layer in the import
  order), and its `hmass` slot delivers the pair at those measures;
* `RamDriverRoot.levelAt` instantiates `wA := arenaWeight n G`,
  `wB := blockWeight n G`, discharges `hmass` by
  `MassWeight.mass_of_alive_compaction_weight`, and the descend clause
  — restated as the cluster *inclusion* in
  `RamDriverCluster.DescendStep` — by
  `MassWeight.arenaWeight_le_blockWeight`;
* the root theorems' cost reads `Kl 0 (n + ns)`
  (`MassWeight.arenaWeight_root`, fed by the `CsrSimple` clause G1
  produces at the boundary — B7 splices `decodeImplementsD` there).

`g2_plug` below is the B8-discipline plug for this wave: the
`g2_exists` witness family applied to the REAL `levelAt`, with the
slots the witness satisfies verbatim consumed silently — `hKmono` and
the Σ-shaped `hKl`, now READ at weights — and the slots it does NOT
satisfy left as explicit hypotheses. **Those hypotheses are the compiled
gap ledger**: each is a carrier-charged domination the landed walks
force, each is refuted for §2-form-sized budgets by the theorem that
follows it, and each names the engine that has to land before it can be
deleted.

**Wave R1.8-T4b closed the first of the five.** The base row is gone from
the implication list: `RamDriver.baseCom` walks the depth's member list,
its charge is read at the arena, and `hKbase_paid` discharges the slot
inside `g2_plug` from the witness's own base clause at any
`Cb ≥ sweepCoeffA`. The other four antecedents stand, so the wave gate
("the witness fits the real slots") is still NOT met, and this section
is the honest compiled record of exactly how far it is from met.

The per-slot verdicts (E6's package survey, 2026-07-31; base row
updated by R1.8-T4b, 2026-08-08):

| slot | landed walk | §2 form dischargeable? | missing engine |
|---|---|---|---|
| `hKo` | `orderImplements₀` at `orderPhaseCost n ns W` | NO (`hKo_gap`) | member-list order phase (design §3(c); `OrderBridge`'s seam) |
| `hKc` | `coverImplements` at `coverPhaseCost n ns` | NO (`hKc_gap`) | block-driven centre body + alive-prefix copy + R1.6 member threading (`CoverBlock` F-2/F-3) |
| `hKd` | `sweepImplements`, loop over the carrier | NO (`hKd_gap`) | member/dead-list sweep (R1.8; caveat: the sweep's WORK is the dead set) — vestigial slot since the flip |
| `hKbase` | `baseImplementsD`, the table fold at the depth's MEMBER LIST (R1.8-T4b) | **YES** (`hKbase_paid`, at `sweepCoeffA`) | — landed; `hKbase_gap`/`hKbase_gap_any` are now the record of the carrier reading it replaced |
| `hKs` | `turnCostSize = turnCost` (descend `16·n²`, scatter `Θ(n·t)`) | NO (`hKs_gap`, `hbnd_gap`) | `BlockLeaves` Com-level swap into `descendCom` + `scatBlockCom` into the turn |

/-- **`hKbase` gap, compiled**, generically in the formula: a base pass
that walks the CARRIER escapes `baseCoeffA · (w + 1)` on a light arena,
because the charge grows with the carrier and the budget does not.

**R1.8-T4b — this is now the historical record, and the size is what
carries it.** It says what it always said, and it is still true, but it
is no longer about the landed pass: the statement reads
`RamDriverBot.baseCost` at a free size argument and picks a *carrier* for
it, and since T4b the base pass's size argument is the depth's member
count. `hKbase_paid` below is the positive statement about the landed
walk — it is paid at `sweepCoeffA` at every size, including this one's
witness — and the two together are the wave's whole cost content: not a
smaller constant (the per-turn charge went UP by three, the member load,
`Refine.DeadSweep.sweepCost_le_baseCost`) but a smaller *set*.

**R1.8-T4a — the floor moved, the gap did not.** The refutation used to
ride the representative scan's `reprBodyCost · n`, which guarded dead
code: that is why the design calls the scan's removal free, and the
removal (`Refine.BaseShed`) is why both sides of this statement are
smaller than they were. -/
theorem hKbase_gap (q_top cap mb ℓ : ℕ) (φ : Lax3.FirstOrder.FO 0) :

  simp only [RamDriverBot.baseCost, baseCoeffA] at h
  nlinarith [Nat.zero_le (RamDriverBot.turnCost q_top cap mb ℓ φ)]

/-- **The `hKbase` gap is not an artifact of the coefficient** — R1.8-T4a
records it coefficient-free, so that shedding a summand from
`baseCoeffA` cannot be mistaken for softening the refutation. For ANY
constant, and every formula and depth, a base pass whose header is the
carrier escapes it on a light arena.

**R1.8-T4b.** This is the sharp form of what the header change had to
beat, and the reason it could not be beaten by accounting:
`Refine.GapsDesign.landed_base_escapes_CbM` is this theorem at the
design's own proposed coefficient. It survives the wave as a statement
about the carrier reading of `RamDriverBot.baseCost`; what the landed
pass is charged at is the member count, and `hKbase_paid` is that. -/
theorem hKbase_gap_any (Cb q_top cap mb ℓ : ℕ) (φ : Lax3.FirstOrder.FO 0) :

  simp only [RamDriverBot.baseCost] at h
  nlinarith [Nat.zero_le (RamDriverBot.turnCost q_top cap mb ℓ φ)]

/-- **`hKbase` PAID** (wave R1.8-T4b) — the positive counterpart of the
two gap theorems above, and the first slot of the §7 ledger to get one.

The landed base pass walks the depth's member list and is charged at the
member count (`RamDriverBot.base_spec`, `RamDriverCompose.baseImplementsD`);
`sweepCoeffA · (w + 1)` pays that at every size, for every formula and
every depth. So the base clause of the `g2_exists`/`g2M` witness families
— `∀ w, Cb · (w + 1) ≤ Kl ℓ w` — discharges the real `hKbase` slot of
`RamDriverRoot.levelAt` at any `Cb` above this coefficient, which is what
`g2_plug` below now does silently instead of leaving it as an
implication.

The coefficient is `sweepCoeffA` and not `baseCoeffA`: since R1.8-T4a the
base pass and the retired dead sweep have one per-turn charge between
them, and the twelve `baseCoeffA` still carries above it were the
representative scan's. -/

/-- **`hKs` gap, compiled.** The real turn cost carries
`descendCost`'s `16·n²` (the six carrier fills), so no
`turnCostSizeA`-sized budget pays a turn on a light block inside a
large carrier. `Refine.BlockLeaves` stops at the NRest/Ir layer — no
`Com`-level block-driven descend leaves exist to swap in yet. -/

/-- **`hbnd`/`hKsc` gap, compiled.** The landed scatter leaf
(`RamDriverIO.atomCom`) copies the carrier-width mask and table per
atom, so E4b's `ScatterBlock.atomCostA` — constant in the carrier
— cannot dominate it. The active-set engine (`ScatterBlock`) is landed
but UNWIRED: `atomCostA` has no consumer in the driver stack. -/

/-- **The E6 plug, honestly.** The `g2_exists` witness family, applied
to the REAL re-threaded `RamDriverRoot.levelAt`. What the witness
satisfies verbatim is consumed silently — its `hKmono`, its Σ-shaped
`hKl` (which since E6 is READ at the arena weight: the conclusion below
is `Kl j (arenaWeight n G M)`, and `Kmass := D` bounds block-WEIGHT sums
via `hdeg`), and **since wave R1.8-T4b its base clause**: `hKbase_paid`
turns `∀ w, Cb · (w + 1) ≤ Kl ℓ w` into the driver's real base slot at
any `Cb` above `sweepCoeffA`, which is the new hypothesis `hCb`. What it
does not satisfy is left as the four remaining explicit implications:
three carrier phase dominations and the carrier turn domination, i.e.
exactly the gap ledger above. When the missing engines land, each
antecedent becomes dischargeable at the witness's own budgets and this
theorem's implication chain collapses into the full plug the wave gate
asked for.

This typechecks only if the witness's `hKmono`/`hKl` fit `levelAt`'s
slots verbatim — the B8 sense in which the moved part of the interface
IS the probe's forms. -/
