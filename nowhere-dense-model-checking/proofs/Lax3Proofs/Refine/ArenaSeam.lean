# The arena seam — the engines' member list, discharged from the driver

Flag F-2 of `plans/nowhere-dense-model-checking/e-mem-design.md`, closed
in the direction that matters. The design's §4 consumer table records
that the block engines carry an `hml : MemList …` hypothesis which
**nothing in the package constructs** — the contract existed, the supply
did not. This file is the supply.

### What closes, and against what

`RamDriver.LevelPre`'s sixteenth clause (rebase E-mem) says the depth
carries a member array `memName j` at physical length `n`, a count
`mnumName j`, and `MemEnum` — the driver's spelling of `MemList` at the
depth's own mask. `MemThreadGate.memList_of_memEnum` is the twin, so the
clause reads as the engines' contract. What was left was the *layout*:
the engines pinned `σ.arrs "mem" = arrOf mm Mem`, a physically
`mm`-cell array, while the driver hands down `n` cells with a live
prefix. That seam is now re-stated (`ScatterBlock.ArenaA` §1), and the
two halves meet here.

### The entry convention, and why it is not `copyCom`

`memEntry j` is the design's read convention verbatim: the count into
`"mm"`, then the LIVE PREFIX into `"mem"` by
`copyUpto (memName j) "mem" (.var "mm")` — the `CoverBlock.memCopy_spec`
leaf shape, `memCopyK mm = 12·mm + 6`. It is deliberately **not**
`RamDriver.copyCom`, the fixed-`n` copy that serves the masks: that is a
carrier walk, the class G2 exists to kill. The count is the runtime
bound, so the copy moves exactly the member cells, and the junk above
the prefix is never read, written, or claimed about — which is why the
copy can leave the destination's tail holding whatever it held.

The contract survives the copy because `MemList` speaks only of `k < mm`
(`MemList.congr_prefix`), and the copy's own postcondition is agreement
on exactly that prefix. Nothing here needs a tail conjunct, and adding
one would re-introduce the carrier walk.

sixteenth clause read through `MemThreadGate.memList_of_memEnum`, plus
the count bound every walk's range obligation is discharged by. -/

/-! ### §3 The member conjuncts of the arena, discharged

The copy runs, and what comes out is the engine's hypothesis. The
`MemList` is the driver's, transported across the copy by
`MemList.congr_prefix` — the copy agrees with the source exactly on the
live prefix, and the live prefix is exactly what the contract reads. -/

/-- **The engine's `hml`, from the driver's state.** Given the depth's
list, `memEntry j` leaves `"mm"` holding the count and `"mem"` holding
an `n`-cell array whose live prefix is the list — i.e. it leaves the
`MemList` hypothesis the block engines take. The charge is the member
copy's, `memCopyK mm + 2`, in which the carrier does not occur. -/

/-! ### §4 The whole arena, from a level

The other entry conditions are the ones `ArenaA` already assumed and
this wave does not touch — the mask, a clean `"dist"`, the two queue
arrays. What is new is that the member conjuncts are no longer assumed:
they come out of `LevelPre`.

**Wave E4c-c: the mask is no longer an entry *copy*.** This file's
`halv` still names `"alv"`, because `ArenaA` does; but the driver's own
atom (`RamDriver.scatDeadCom`) runs
`Refine.ScatterBlock.scatBlockComA (alvName (j + 1))` at
`Refine.ScatterBlock.ArenaAt`, whose mask clause is the depth's own
array and whose producer is `RamDriverCluster.ClusterData`'s mask
conjunct directly — no copy, and no scratch to leave junk in. The
statements below are the `"alv"` instance of the same seam, kept because
`scatBlock_of_levelPre` is stated at the landed engine. -/

/-- **The re-stated arena, discharged driver-side.** From a level state
and the engine's own scratch, the member copy leaves an `ArenaA` at the
threaded layout — physical length `n`, live prefix `mm` — together with
the `MemList` every block walk of `ScatterBlock` takes as a hypothesis.

The target array reading is the level's own `W`: `LevelPre` carries
`"tgt"` at the allocation width (rebase F-c-4), and `ArenaA` is stated
at an arbitrary target length for exactly this reason. -/

/-! ### §5 The seam closed, end to end

The engine that the member list was built for, run from a level state.
Nothing about the scatter pass changes — `scatBlock_specW` is the landed
export, applied — and the point is that its two member hypotheses are no
longer assumptions of the caller. -/

/-- **A block scatter pass, driven from the driver's own state.** The
member copy followed by the landed active-set pass decides the scatter
sentence about the depth's arena, at the member charge plus the copy's.
Neither `n` nor `ns` occurs in the charge. -/

/-! ### §6 The seam at concrete shapes

A four-vertex carrier whose mask leaves two vertices alive. The member
array is four cells long — the carrier's length — and its live prefix is
two: the third and fourth cells hold `99`, which is not a vertex, is not
claimed about, and is never read. This is the layout the driver hands
down, and the `example` is the check that the re-stated `Prop`s accept
it while the old length would not. -/

/-- Two vertices alive out of four. -/
def demoMask : ℕ → ℕ := fun z => if z = 1 then 1 else if z = 3 then 1 else 0

/-- Their list: two live cells, then junk. -/
def demoMem : ℕ → ℕ := fun k => if k = 0 then 1 else if k = 1 then 3 else 99

junk tail is not a member and is not claimed about**: `demoMem 2 = 99`
is not even a vertex of the four-vertex carrier. -/

/-- **The re-stated arena accepts the threaded layout.** Physical length
four, live prefix two, `nt = 7` (a target array wider than the block
structure, as `LevelPre`'s `W` is). -/

/-- **And the old length-clause would refuse it** — the negative control
that the seam actually moved. The member array of the threaded layout is
four cells, not two; before this wave the arena demanded `arrOf mm Mem`,
which no depth of the driver ever hands an engine. -/
