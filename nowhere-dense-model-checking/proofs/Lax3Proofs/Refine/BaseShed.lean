**The base case's shed, recorded** — R1.8-T4a, the cost half.

`RamDriver.baseCom` used to be `reprCom` followed by the depth's sweep.
The representative scan's only product is the array `"rep"`, and the
only text that reads it is the `exU` case of `RamDriver.botCom` — a case
generated for no formula any table holds, because every tabled formula
is local (`FormulaTables.tableRank_of_mem_tablesAt`, read as
`Refine.DeadRowProbe.tabled_isLocal`) and `botCom` on a local formula
has no `exU` node. So the scan guarded dead code, and the base pass paid
for it: a second carrier walk whose turn is an inner loop over the whole
row space `2 ^ sigL cap mb ℓ`.

`RamDriverBot.baseCost` now sheds exactly that summand. This file is the
ledger of the shed: what the old constant was (`oldBaseCost`), that the
difference is `RamDriverBot.reprCost` on the nose (`shed_eq_reprCost`),
that the new constant is *strictly* smaller (`baseCost_lt_old`), and
that the shed is not a rounding — it is at least `2 ^ sigL cap mb ℓ`
per carrier vertex (`pow_mul_le_shed`).

# What did NOT change (at R1.8-T4a), and what T4b then changed

R1.8-T4a left the base pass walking the **carrier**, so the base's charge
stayed carrier-linear and `Refine.G2CostProbe.hKbase_gap` still refuted a
weight-linear budget for it. What T4a changed is the gap's floor: it used
to be the scan's `reprBodyCost · n` — a floor guarding dead code, which is
why the design calls the scan's removal free — and it became the sweep's
own `(turnCost + 4) · n`, real work at every vertex.

**Wave T4b then moved the header**, and with it the size the charge is
read at: `RamDriverBot.baseCost` is now the depth's member walk, at the
arena. The constants below are the pre-T4b ones and are stated at
`shedBaseCost`, this file's own name for them; nothing here tracks the
live charge, because this file is a ledger of what T4a removed and not a
statement about the current pass.

Nothing about `RamDriver.reprCom`, `RamDriverBot.repr_spec` or
`RamDriverBot.reprCost` is deleted: they stay compiled as the machine
half of the contingency `Refine.DeadRowProbe.sat_exU_bot_via_cluster`
describes, and `oldBaseCost` below is the only remaining consumer of
`reprCost` in the package.

/-- **The base cost as it stood after R1.8-T4a and before R1.8-T4b**: the
depth's sweep at the carrier, which is what this file's ledger is about.

Until wave T4b this was `RamDriverBot.baseCost` itself. That constant has
since moved twice over — its size argument is the depth's *member count*
and its per-turn charge is three higher (the member load) — so the shed's
statements are pinned here, at the constant they were made about, rather
than tracking a name whose meaning has changed. What T4b did to the
carrier reading is `Refine.DeadSweep.sweepCost_le_baseCost`; that it is
the reading no budget of the G2 interface could pay is
`Refine.G2CostProbe.hKbase_gap_any`, which is why the header moved. -/

/-! ### Falsification: the two constants on numbers

The base cost changed, so it is checked on a concrete instance in both
directions before it is used. `turnCost` is noncomputable (`tablesAt`),
so the walk's per-vertex charge is a parameter `K` here and the scan's
half is the **real** `reprCost` — the only half that moved.

The instance is depth `ℓ = 3`, palette width `L = 4` (sixteen rows), a
carrier of `100`, and a per-vertex turn charge `K = 10`. -/
