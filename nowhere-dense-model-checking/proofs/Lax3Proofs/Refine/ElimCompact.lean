# ND-MC G2/E2-elim — the compacted-arena elimination engine

`Refine/OrderEngineProbe.lean` is this file's warrant. Its coupling
table refuted every IN-PLACE member pass at every slot of the landed
order phase, and its residual list named the repair:

> **In-place member passes cannot be the engine repair.** … A
> member-driven elimination is therefore the **compacted-arena** engine
> of g2-cost-design §3(c): the member list renumbers the arena
> (`mm` vertices, member-row slots), the engine runs at carrier `mm`,
> and the outputs scatter back through the list.

This file is that engine. §1 is the program; §2 the compiled data; §3
the *length seam* — the one real obstruction and its generic repair;
§4 the engine transported to the arena; §5 the contract at the arena's
members; §6 the costs; §7 the bridge to the landed reading; §8 the
composite, on two named walk obligations; §9 what E2-aug and E2-sym
copy.

## The one thing the wave had to discover

`RamElim.elimCom` is already **carrier-parametric**: every one of its
five passes is bounded by the runtime scalar `"n"` (`initDeg`,
`initBuck`, `elimLoop`, `offPass`, `fillPass` all loop on `.var "n"`),
and its landed specification `RamElim.implementsW` quantifies over that
carrier. So "run the engine at carrier `mm`" needs **no
re-synthesis at all**: set `"n" := mm`, hand it the compacted CSR, and
`RamElim.elim_specW` applies verbatim at `n := mm`. The heartbeat
ceilings of `ElimSynth7` are not spent here; the engine is reused as
capital, exactly as the campaign asks.

What *does* stand in the way is a length seam, and it is worth naming
precisely because it is the same seam in every engine family:

> `RamElim.ElimPreW` pins the **physical** length of eleven arrays to
> the carrier scalar (`σ.arrs "alv" = arrOf n M`, `arrOf (n+1)` for the
> offsets, `arrOf (n+W+1)` for the bucket arena, …). At carrier `mm` it
> therefore asks for `mm`-cell arrays — and an IMP+ run cannot
> re-allocate, so what the driver holds is `n`-cell arrays with an
> `mm`-cell live prefix.

§3 closes it *generically*, in the semantics rather than in any engine:
appending a tail to every array of an environment changes no run
(`bigStepB_padArrs`), because the only length-sensitive rule is the
store's in-range side condition and appending only widens it, and no
expression of IMP+ reads a length. So a run on the `mm`-cell **view** of
the store is a run on the store itself, and the landed contract holds of
the view. Two consequences, both load-bearing:

* the landed engine's specification is reusable at any carrier below the
  physical one, with **no restatement of `RamElim`** (which stays
  read-only capital);
* the exit state is literally `⟨engine's compact prefix⟩ ++ ⟨the tail it
  entered with⟩`, per array — i.e. **the engine touches no carrier
  cell**, which is the statement `OrderEngineProbe`'s read-seam (§4) and
  zero-seam (§2) died for the want of. The re-zero between two calls is
  `fillUpto … (.var "mm")`, not a carrier fill.

## What is *not* here, and where it goes

Two walks are isolated as named obligations in §8, in the campaign's
obligation-Props discipline: `CompactInstalls` (the compaction pass
leaves a `CsrSimple` block structure of the member pullback, installed at
the engine's entry) and `ScatterBacksW` (the scatter sends the compact
ranks to the members' arena cells). Both are refuted-before-proved on
data in §2, stated once, and discharged in their own satellites
(`Refine/ElimCompactWalks.lean`, `Refine/ElimCompactCsr.lean`). Nothing
here is `sorry`, and no theorem below assumes either of them except
`elimCompact_spec`, which names them as hypotheses.

The driver and phase text are untouched: this is a satellite. The
level-CSR save/restore that the composite carries (§1) is nonetheless a
*finding* for the phase text — see §6's note.

/-! ## §1 The program

Six blocks, one `Com`. All six loop on `"mm"` or on the compact slot
counter `"ks"`; the carrier scalar `"n"` occurs in exactly one place —
`installCom`'s `n := mm`, which is what makes the engine's own five
loops arena-bounded — and is restored at the end.

The cell discipline is a fresh `k`-prefix (`"km"` the member index,
`"ku"`/`"kw"` the arena vertices, `"kj"`/`"ke"` the row bounds, `"ks"`
the compact slot counter, `"kn"` the saved carrier), so no landed pass's
scalar is disturbed; the arrays are `"kof"`/`"ktg"` (the compact CSR),
`"kix"` (the inverse numbering), `"ork"` (the arena-numbered ranks) and
`"qof"`/`"qtg"`/`"qav"` (the prefix save). Frame lemmas in §1.4. -/

/-! ### §1.1 Renumbering -/

/-- **The inverse numbering.** Member `k` of the list becomes compact
vertex `k`; this pass writes that map into `"kix"` at the members'
arena positions. `O(mm)` — the array is carrier-length, the walk is
not, and the non-member cells are never written and never read. -/
def cixPass : Com :=
  .seq (.assign "km" (.lit 0))
    (.while (.lt (.var "km") (.var "mm"))
      (.seq (.assign "ku" (.get "mem" (.var "km")))
        (.seq (.store "kix" (.var "ku") (.var "km"))
          (.assign "km" (.add (.var "km") (.lit 1))))))

/-- One member's compact row: the arena row of `mem[km]`, its live
targets renumbered through `"kix"` and appended to `"ktg"`, and the
member's block closed in `"kof"`. The row is read at the *arena*
vertex, so no non-member row is ever walked — this is g2-cost-design
§3(c)'s "the engines read the level graph through the member list". -/
def cRow : Com :=
  .seq (.assign "ku" (.get "mem" (.var "km")))
    (.seq (.assign "kj" (.get "off" (.var "ku")))
      (.seq (.assign "ke" (.get "off" (.add (.var "ku") (.lit 1))))
        (.seq (.while (.lt (.var "kj") (.var "ke"))
                (.seq (.assign "kw" (.get "tgt" (.var "kj")))
                  (.seq (.ite (.lt (.lit 0) (.get "alv" (.var "kw")))
                          (.seq (.store "ktg" (.var "ks") (.get "kix" (.var "kw")))
                            (.assign "ks" (.add (.var "ks") (.lit 1))))
                          .skip)
                    (.assign "kj" (.add (.var "kj") (.lit 1))))))
          (.seq (.assign "km" (.add (.var "km") (.lit 1)))
            (.store "kof" (.var "km") (.var "ks"))))))

/-- **The compacted CSR**, built in one member-driven pass: offsets in
`"kof"` over `mm+1` cells, targets in `"ktg"` over the arena's live
degree sum, which the pass leaves in `"ks"`. -/
def compactCsr : Com :=
  .seq (.store "kof" (.lit 0) (.lit 0))
    (.seq (.assign "ks" (.lit 0))
      (.seq (.assign "km" (.lit 0))
        (.while (.lt (.var "km") (.var "mm")) cRow)))

/-- **The renumbering**, both passes. -/
def compactPass : Com := .seq cixPass compactCsr

/-! ### §1.2 The prefix save, and the install

The compaction writes only *prefixes* of `off`/`tgt`/`alv` — cells
`[0, mm]`, `[0, ks)` and `[0, mm)`. That is the point of the compacted
design and it is what makes the save a **prefix copy of arena-class
length**, where `OrderEngineProbe` §3 refuted a member scatter. -/

/-- Save the three prefixes the install overwrites, and the carrier. -/
def savePre : Com :=
  .seq (.assign "kn" (.var "n"))
    (.seq (copyUpto "off" "qof" (.add (.var "mm") (.lit 1)))
      (.seq (copyUpto "tgt" "qtg" (.var "ks"))
        (copyUpto "alv" "qav" (.var "mm"))))

/-- Put them back, and the carrier with them. -/
def restorePre : Com :=
  .seq (.assign "n" (.var "kn"))
    (.seq (copyUpto "qof" "off" (.add (.var "mm") (.lit 1)))
      (.seq (copyUpto "qtg" "tgt" (.var "ks"))
        (copyUpto "qav" "alv" (.var "mm"))))

/-- **The engine's entry, compacted.** The compact CSR into the
engine's own array names, the all-alive mask over the compact carrier
(compaction made the dead vertices *nonexistent*, so the mask is a
constant — `OrderEngineProbe` §4's read-seam has nothing to read), the
two zeroed-scratch prefixes `RamElim.ElimPre` asks for, and the carrier
scalar moved to `mm`. **Every fill is `mm`-bounded**: this is the
zero-seam (§2 of the probe) dead, since the re-zero between two engine
calls is now arena-class and not carrier-class. -/
def installCom : Com :=
  .seq (copyUpto "kof" "off" (.add (.var "mm") (.lit 1)))
    (.seq (copyUpto "ktg" "tgt" (.var "ks"))
      (.seq (fillUpto "alv" (.var "mm") (.lit 1))
        (.seq (fillUpto "elm" (.var "mm") (.lit 0))
          (.seq (fillUpto "bh" (.add (.var "mm") (.lit 1)) (.lit 0))
            (.assign "n" (.var "mm"))))))

/-! ### §1.3 Scatter-back, and the whole engine -/

/-- **Scatter-back.** The engine ranked the compact vertices; this walk
sends rank `rnk[k]` to the arena vertex `mem[k]`. Member-driven,
`O(mm)`, and it writes nothing at a non-member cell. -/
def scatterCom : Com :=
  .seq (.assign "km" (.lit 0))
    (.while (.lt (.var "km") (.var "mm"))
      (.seq (.assign "ku" (.get "mem" (.var "km")))
        (.seq (.store "ork" (.var "ku") (.get "rnk" (.var "km")))
          (.assign "km" (.add (.var "km") (.lit 1))))))

/-- **The compacted engine, core**: renumber, install, run the landed
engine, scatter back. The level CSR is left compacted — a caller that
needs it back wraps this in the prefix save/restore (`elimCompactCom`).
-/
def elimCompactCore : Com :=
  .seq (.seq compactPass installCom) (.seq Lax3Proofs.RamElim.elimCom scatterCom)

/-- **The compacted engine, frame-clean**: the core between the prefix
save and the prefix restore, so that `off`/`tgt`/`alv` and the carrier
scalar come out exactly as they went in. -/
def elimCompactCom : Com :=
  .seq compactPass
    (.seq savePre
      (.seq installCom
        (.seq Lax3Proofs.RamElim.elimCom (.seq scatterCom restorePre))))

/-! ### §1.4 Frames

What the wave owns writes only its own cells and the engine's. Read off
the syntax, one `simp` apiece — the discipline `OrderSigProbeM` runs on
(pre-owned destinations only; no pass writes an array an earlier pass
produced except through the named install). -/

/-! ## §2 The compiled data

The wave's instances, run on the probe interpreter of
`TgtWidenProbe` (`execC pB pF`, the clock-carrying twin of
`Lax13Proofs.BigStepB`). The arena is `RamElim.Demo`'s graph — the
triangle `0—1—2` with the path `2—3—4`, five vertices, degeneracy two —
placed at the **odd** vertices `1, 3, 5, 7, 9` of a carrier of any size,
every other row of the level CSR empty and every other mask cell dead.
So the composite's answer must be `Demo`'s answer, scattered. -/

/-- The store the composite runs in: `augSt`'s twenty-six arrays at
their lengths, plus the wave's own seven, with the level CSR, the mask
and the member list as parameters. -/

`RamElim.Demo` (that file's worked example) records: ranks `0 1 2 3 4`,
`kmax = 2`, in-lists `∅, {0}, {0,1}, {2}, {3}` — offsets `0 0 1 3 4 5`
and targets `0 0 1 2 3`. The composite must produce exactly those, in

The wave's central operational claim (§3 proves it). The store enters
with a **sentinel tail**: every cell of the eleven engine arrays above
the compact prefix holds `7`, and the composite must hand every one of
them back. A carrier-class pass — the landed `elimCom` at carrier `n`,
or any of the landed phase's `fillCom`s — would erase them. -/

/-! ### §2.4 The frame: the level CSR comes back

`elimCompactCom` overwrites only prefixes, so the prefix save restores
the level's own block structure — the exact repair
`OrderEngineProbe` §3 refuted for a member scatter. Instance: a level
CSR whose **dead** rows differ from anything the compaction writes (the
probe's wedge, at the odd placement), plus a dead target inside a live
row, which is what separates the live degree sum from the raw one. -/

/-- The wedge: vertex `1`'s row also lists the DEAD vertex `2`, so the
live degree sum (`10`) is strictly below the raw row-length sum (`11`),
and the dead rows of `off` carry values no compaction produces. -/

section is about the elimination: it is a fact about IMP+, and E2-aug
and E2-sym consume it unchanged.

The two observations that make it work:

* **no expression of IMP+ reads a length.** `Expr.evalB`'s only
  array clause is `((σ.arrs a)[k]?).bind (fit B)`, which is `some` only
  when `k` is in range and then depends on the cell alone;
* **the only length-sensitive rule is the store's** `hk : k <
  (σ.arrs a).length`, and appending a tail only widens it.

So appending tails to every array changes no derivation and no clock. -/

/-- **The compacted engine call.** `RamElim.elimCom`, unchanged, at the
compact carrier `mm`, on a store whose arrays are the carrier's: it
runs, at `RamElim.elimCost mm ns` — a cost in which **the carrier does
not occur** — and leaves `RamElim.ElimPost`, the landed contract,
verbatim, of the compact view. The exit store is the view's answer over
the tail the call entered with.

No re-synthesis and no restatement of `RamElim`: `elim_specWR` is
applied at `n := mm`, which is all "the engine runs at carrier `mm`"
ever needed.

rank is below the compact carrier. It is not decoration: the scatter
reads `rnk[km]` with an IMP+ `get` and has no derivation without it
(`ScatterBacksW`'s `hRB`). `ElimMem` — and so `ElimPost` — dropped the

carrier-sized and that no engine repair can change that — the consumer
has to move. This section is the engine's own half of that move: the
elimination's contract, restated so that **nothing in it ranges over the
carrier**. Its subject is the compacted arena, and the compacted arena
is a graph on `Fin mm`: the level's masked graph pulled back along the
member list. -/

Clause for clause `RamElim.ElimPost`, with three deliberate moves:

* the graph is `memGraph` — the arena renumbered — so every
  quantifier ranges over `Fin mm` and **no clause mentions the
  carrier**;
* the ranks are read at the members' *arena* cells, `ork[mem j]`, which
  is what `scatterCom` writes: a member reading, not a carrier array;
* the in-lists stay in the **compact** numbering (`ioff` over `mm + 1`
  cells, `itg`), because their consumer — the augmentation engine, wave
  E2-aug — is compacted too. Re-numbering them back would be a second
  scatter nobody reads.

Nothing here is a `∀ v < n`. That is the whole point: the hazard the
wave was warned about is that the carrier walks back in through the
statement. -/

/-! ## §6 The cost: arena-affine, carrier-blind

The composite's clock, and the two things that make it the wave's
deliverable: the carrier does not occur in it, and the arena's own two
numbers do. -/

/-- **The composite's cost**: the landed engine's own `elimCost` at the
compact carrier, plus the six member-driven passes (renumber, prefix
save, install, scatter, prefix restore) at a generous constant. `mm` is
the arena's live vertex count and `w` its slot reading — **the carrier
`n` does not appear**, which is the whole claim of the wave.

The second argument is read at the arena's **raw** member-row sum
(`memRowSum`), not at the compact slot count: the compaction crosses the
members' rows in the level CSR and pays for the dead targets it drops,
which the live count does not see (§6.2, and the compiled instance in
`ElimCompactWalks` §3.1). Both readings are carrier-blind and
arena-relative, and `elimCost` is monotone in the second, so the same
function serves. -/
def elimCompactCost (mm w : ℕ) : ℕ := Lax3Proofs.RamElim.elimCost mm w + 300 * mm + 300 * w + 300

/-- The renumbering-and-install budget read at the **live** slot count.
This is the reading `ElimCompactWalks` §3.1 refutes — `cRow` crosses the
member's *raw* row and the live count does not see the dead targets it
drops — and it is kept because that refutation is compiled against it.
The honest charge is `compactCostRaw`, below. -/
def compactCost (mm cs : ℕ) : ℕ := 100 * mm + 100 * cs + 100

/-- **The members' raw row-length sum** — what `cRow`'s inner loop
crosses, member by member. Carrier-blind and arena-relative, like the
live count and unlike the carrier: it is the `csrW` reading of
`MassWeight` §1 (the machine's own weight) as against the `graphW`
reading that `arenaWeight` uses, and `ElimCompactWalks.wsum_csrW_markSet`
is that identity. -/

raw member-row sum instead of the live slot count — the charge the walk
actually pays. -/

two numbers, and in nothing else. -/

#guard ¬ (elimCompactCost 5 10 = 901 * 5 + 901 * 10 + 400)

/-- **The three budgets compose.** The compaction at the raw sum, the
engine at the live slot count, and the scatter, all inside the
composite's cost read at the raw sum. `elimCost` is monotone in its
second argument, which is what lets one number carry both readings. -/

/-- **…and the weight is the compacted arena's own.** `MassWeight`'s
root reading at the compact graph: a `CsrSimple` of a graph all of whose
vertices are alive has weight `mm + cs`, the vertex count plus the slot
count. So the composite's clock is `900 · arenaWeight + 400` at the
arena the engine actually ran on, with the carrier nowhere in sight. -/

/-! ## §7 The bridge to the landed reading

The wave's contract is a restatement, so it owes the statement that it
*is* one: on the all-alive arena at the identity numbering — `mm = n`,
`mem` the identity, every vertex live — `ElimMemPost` is
`RamElim.ElimPost`, clause for clause. This is the compiled
non-weakening check the campaign asks of every restated theorem. -/

/-- The identity member list of an all-alive arena: every vertex is a
member, in order. -/

  lt := fun _ hj => hj
  smono := fun _ _ hij _ => hij
  sound := fun j hj => ⟨hj, h j hj⟩
  complete := fun a ha => ⟨a, ha.lt, rfl⟩

/-- At the identity numbering the compacted arena is the arena. -/
theorem memGraph_id {n : ℕ} (G : SimpleGraph (Fin n)) {M : ℕ → ℕ}

  exact Iff.of_eq (by rw [show memEmb (idMemList h) u = u from Fin.ext rfl,
    show memEmb (idMemList h) v = v from Fin.ext rfl])

/-- **The bridge.** On the all-alive arena at the identity numbering,
the wave's member contract holds of exactly the states the landed
contract holds of — with `"ork"` reading `"rnk"`, which is what
`scatterCom` degenerates to when `mem` is the identity. So the
restatement of §5 weakens nothing: it is the landed `ElimPost` with the
carrier replaced by the member list, and at `mm = n` the two coincide.

/-- The converse reading, so the bridge is an equivalence and not a
weakening in disguise: at the identity numbering the member clauses give
the landed ones back for the three answers the phase consumes (the rank
array's contract is `"ork"`'s, the bound is `kmax`, the in-lists are
`ioff`/`itg`). -/

/-! ## §8 The composite: two named obligations and the assembly

The two remaining *walks* — that `compactPass ; installCom` builds the
member pullback's block structure and leaves the engine's entry, and
that `scatterCom` sends the compact ranks to the members' arena cells —
are isolated as named `Prop`s in the campaign's obligation discipline
(`plans/…/obligation-Props-discipline`): refuted-before-proved on data
(§2.1, §2.2), stated once, discharged in their own satellites. They are
hypotheses of the assembly below and of nothing else; every other
theorem in this file stands on its own.

What the assembly itself proves is the part that is *not* a walk and is
where a compacted engine could still go wrong: that the two obligations
plus §4's transported engine compose into the arena contract of §5 at a
cost in which the carrier does not occur. -/

/-- **The composite's entry**: the arena as the driver hands it down —
level CSR, mask, member list at the carrier's physical length, and the
engine's thirteen scratch arrays plus the wave's own four, at their
lengths. `ArenaSeam.memEntry` is what puts `"mem"`/`"mm"` here. -/

  (∃ g, σ.arrs "itg" = arrOf W g)

/-- **Obligation E2-c/1 — the compaction walk.** `compactPass` followed
by `installCom` leaves the compacted engine's entry: a `CsrSimple` block
structure of the member pullback at slot count `"ks"`, installed in the
engine's own array names, with the all-alive mask and the two zeroed
prefixes, at `compactCostRaw`.

Refutable, and refuted-before-proved on data in §2.1 (the compact CSR is
`RamElim.Demo`'s at two carriers; the slot count is the *live* degree sum
and not the raw one, separated on §2.4's wedge).

Two clauses of the statement are the E2-fold repair, and both are
compiled findings of `ElimCompactWalks` rather than taste:

* **the charge is `compactCostRaw mm (memRowSum mm O Mem)`.** The
  earlier reading, `compactCost mm cs` at the live slot count, is false:
  `cRow` walks the member's raw row in the level CSR and drops the dead
  targets by an `ite` *inside* the loop, so it pays for them. On the
  dead-row star the clock is `849` against a budget of `200`
  (`ElimCompactWalks` §3.1). `cs ≤ memRowSum mm O Mem` comes with it —
  the live slots are a subset of the raw ones — and is what lets the
  composite's cost be read at one number.
* **the three word bounds.** `Run B` is a *derivation*: without
  `mm + nt + 1 < B` and `n < B` neither the loop tests nor the array
  reads evaluate and no run exists at all, so the conclusion fails
  vacuously. Every landed specification of the package carries a clause
  of this shape (`RamElim.elim_specW`'s `hB`).

  The third, `∀ v < n, M v < B`, is the **mask's own magnitude** and is
  the one that is easy to miss: `ArenaEntryC` pins the mask's *length*
  (`σ.arrs "alv" = arrOf n M`) and says nothing whatever about the
  numbers in it, while `cRow` tests liveness with
  `.lt (.lit 0) (.get "alv" (.var "kw"))` — an IMP+ `get`, whose value
  must `fit B`. At a mask cell of `100` in a machine of word bound `6`
  the read returns `none`, the derivation stops, and the conclusion is
  unreachable however good the program is. This is exactly
  `RamElim.elim_specW`'s `hMB : ∀ z < n, M z < B`, which the landed
  engine has carried all along; the compacted entry surface had lost it
  because `ArenaEntryC` replaced `ElimPre`'s clause list. The compiled
  falsification is in `Refine/ElimCompactCsr.lean` §0.

**A seam in `T'`, for whoever reads it next.** The `CsrSimple` and the
`ElimPreC` below are stated at the *same* `T'`, and that function is a
**merge**, not the compact target array: `installCom` copies only the
first `cs` cells of `"ktg"` into `"tgt"`, so `T'` is the compact targets
below `cs = O' mm` and the **level's own targets** at and above it. An
IMP+ run cannot re-allocate, so the tail cannot be cleared and this is
not a defect — `CsrSimple (memGraph …) cs O' T'` holds because every one
of its clauses reads `T'` only below `cs` (`target_lt` at `j < cs`,
`adj_iff` and `nodup` inside rows of vertices below `mm`, whose blocks
end at `O' mm = cs`). Nothing in `elimCompact_spec` or in
`RamElim.elim_specWR` reads above `cs` today.

The tripwire is for a *future* consumer: a pass that reads `T'` at a slot
`≥ cs` expecting compact data will silently get level-numbered vertices,
which are arena numbers and not member indices. If such a consumer
appears, it must either be bounded by `cs` or be handed a `T'` whose tail
was overwritten. -/

/-- **The scatter walk, as first frozen — and refuted.**
`ElimCompactWalks.not_scatterBacks_of_repeat` exhibits a member list that
repeats an arena number, at which this postcondition asks one cell to
hold two ranks and no state satisfies it. The `Prop` is kept because that
refutation is compiled against it. `ScatterBacksW` below is the repaired
obligation, and it is what this file's assembly consumes — and, since
wave E2-width, `Refine/AugCompact.lean`'s too, so no theorem in the
package now *assumes* the reading below. -/

      σ'.arrs "ioff" = σ.arrs "ioff" ∧ σ'.arrs "itg" = σ.arrs "itg"

/-- **Obligation E2-c/2 — the scatter walk.** `scatterCom` sends the
compact rank of member `j` to the arena cell `ork[mem j]`, touching
nothing else. Refuted-before-proved in §2.2 (the scattered ranks at the
odd placement) and §2.3 (nothing above the prefixes moves).

Four clauses more than the reading above, and **nothing in the
conclusion changes**:

* `hsm` — the member list is strictly increasing, hence repetition-free.
  This is `MemList.smono`, which the assembly already holds;
  `ElimCompactWalks.not_scatterBacks_of_repeat` is the compiled proof
  that it cannot be dropped.
* `hnB` — the carrier fits in a word. Without it neither the loop test
  nor the `mem` read evaluates, and `Run` is a derivation.
* `hRB`, `hρlen` — the ranks are readable: `scatterCom` reads `rnk[km]`
  with an IMP+ `get`, which needs the cell to exist and to hold a word.
  The `getD` clause gives neither (it is satisfied by the empty array at
  `R = 0`). `hRB` is what `RamElim.RnkLt` supplies — the clause the
  landed `ElimPost` dropped and E2-fold threaded back.

One obligation for two families: `Refine/AugCompact.lean` runs the same

/-- **The compacted engine implements the arena contract.** The two
obligations, §4's transported engine, and nothing else. Read the cost:
`elimCompactCost mm (memRowSum mm O Mem)` — the arena's live vertex count
and its raw member-row sum, and **no carrier term**. That is the wave.

`n < B` joins `mm + nt + 1 < B`: the member list is read at arena numbers
(`mem[km]`, `ork[mem k]`), so the carrier has to be a word even though it
occurs in no cost and in no clause of the conclusion. `hMB` joins them
for the mask, which the compaction reads at every slot of every member
row; it is `RamElim.elim_specW`'s own `hMB`, and the engine call below
would need it even if the compaction did not. All three are held by every
landed caller of the package. -/

/-! ## §9 The template — what E2-aug and E2-sym copy

The two sibling engine waves of `g2-cost-design` §6 (`RamAugment.augCom`
and `RamDriver.symCom`) meet exactly the same seam, and four of the five
pieces above are reusable verbatim.

1. **§3 is generic and is imported, not re-proved.** `padArrs`,
   `cutArrs`, `tailOf`, `bigStepB_padArrs`, `run_of_run_cutArrs`,
   `tail_preserved`, `bigStepB_length`, `take_arrOf`, `arrOf_congr` are
   facts about IMP+, not about the elimination. Each sibling needs only
   its own `clen` schedule (the length of each of *its* arrays as a
   function of the compact carrier) and its own `…PreC` — the landed
   precondition with the physical lengths at `n` and the contract at
   `mm` — and then one `elimPreW_cutArrs`-shaped lemma, which is one
   `take_arrOf` and one `arrOf_congr` per clause and nothing else.
2. **No re-synthesis.** Check first whether the landed engine's loops
   are bounded by the runtime scalar `"n"` rather than by a literal. For
   the elimination all five passes were, so `elim_specW` applied at
   `n := mm` and the `ElimSynth7` heartbeat ceilings were never touched.
   `augCom` and `symCom` should be read the same way *before* any
   synthesis is attempted.
3. **`compactPass`/`installCom`/`scatterCom` are shared plumbing.** The
   compacted CSR, the inverse numbering `"kix"`, and the member scatter
   do not depend on which engine runs in between; a sibling reuses
   `compactPass` and `installCom` unchanged and supplies its own
   scatter-back if its outputs are not ranks. `CompactInstalls` is
   therefore one obligation for all three families, once discharged.
4. **The prefix save/restore is the finding for the phase text.** The
   compaction writes only the prefixes `off[0…mm]`, `tgt[0…ks)` and
   `alv[0…mm)`, so `savePre`/`restorePre` are *prefix* copies of
   arena-class length. This is why `OrderEngineProbe` §3's restore-seam
   dies in the compacted design and does not die for a member scatter:
   the write set is a prefix, not a member set. `RamDriver.saveCsr`'s
   `n+1`-cell offset copy becomes `copyUpto "off" "gof" (.add (.var "mm")
   (.lit 1))` — the E-order wave's own §3(b) delta, now with a reason.
5. **The one clause a sibling must re-authorise** is the all-alive mask.
   `masked_of_all_alive` is what turns the compact call's mask into a
   constant; an engine whose contract reads the mask for something other
   than isolation would need more.

The residual arithmetic tie, common to all three: `elimCompactCost` is
bounded by the *compacted* arena's own weight (`§6`,
`MassWeight.arenaWeight_root` at the compact graph) — and, read at the
raw member-row sum the compaction actually pays, by the level arena's
`csrW` weight (`ElimCompactWalks.wsum_csrW_markSet`). Tying that to the
level arena's weight — `arenaWeight mm (memGraph G M hml) 1 =
arenaWeight n (masked G M) M`, a `wsum` transported along the injection
`memEmb` whose image is the mark set — is a `MassWeight` lemma, not an
engine lemma, and belongs to E5's weighted-twin wave. -/
