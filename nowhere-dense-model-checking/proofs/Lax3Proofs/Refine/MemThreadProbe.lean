# E-mem-design — the member-list clause of `LevelPre`, compiled both ways

R1.6, the road's last design gate before the order/cover re-synthesis:
thread a per-depth member list into the driver's level state, so the
member-driven engine family (`OrderSigProbeM`'s measured `68·m + 12`
phase, `ScatterBlock`'s block engines) has something to drive it. This
file is the design's compiled half; the design document is
`plans/nowhere-dense-model-checking/e-mem-design.md`. **Nothing here
edits a landed declaration** — `LevelPreM` is a standalone `Prop` of
this namespace that *references* `RamDriver.LevelPre`, and every
program is a probe shape.

What is compiled, in the two directions the standing rule asks for:

* **Existence** (§3). The proposed clause is inhabited by driver-shaped
  machines: a root-shaped `Env` (all-alive mask, identity member list)
  satisfies `LevelPreM` at depth 0, and the SAME `Env` after a
  descend-like update — the child masks, the child member list, the
  child count, written with `Env.setArr`/`Env.setVar` exactly as
  `descendCom`'s stores would — satisfies it at depth 1
  (`levelPreM_root`, `levelPreM_child`). The `n = 0` control
  (`memClause_zero_carrier`) is the flip-gate hazard check: the clause
  stays satisfiable on the empty input word, which is why it carries
  **no** tail-content conjunct (a zero-tail would also force producers
  to clear junk tails — a touched-only violation).
* **The `∃`-packaging is lossless** (§2): `memList_unique` — two member
  lists of the same mask agree in count and content on the live
  prefix — so the clause can be carried existentially (the `DepthMem`
  idiom), leaving `LevelPre`'s *signature* unchanged and the blast
  radius at destructurings + frame lemmas only.
* **Producer cost, positive** (§4): the member-emission add-on on the
  landed `clusterLoad` shape (`clusterLoadM` — one store and one
  counter bump inside the existing block scan) and the child filter
  pass (`memFilterCom` — the block list against the child mask, in
  place) are both charged at the BLOCK: their clocks on
  `TgtWidenProbe.execC` are pinned equal at carriers 100 and 200 and
  linear in the block size. The emission preserves the block order and
  the filter is stable, so sortedness flows down from the parent's
  emission order (`emitLoop` walks the carrier in index order — the
  supply of `MemList.smono`, see the design doc §3).
* **Producer cost, negative** (§4): `memFromMaskCom` — building the
  list from the mask alone — is a carrier scan: its clock GROWS by
  `9` per carrier vertex between the same two carriers at a fixed
  two-member arena. This is `OrderBlockProbe`'s prose claim ("building
  it from the mask is itself a carrier scan"), made compiled. And
  `unsorted_emission_refuted`: a BFS-ordered (unsorted) block emission
  cannot feed the clause — `MemList.smono` fails on data — which pins
  the E3 interaction recorded in the design doc.
* **Consumer direction** (§5): the copy-into-fixed-name convention at
  the LIVE PREFIX — `copyUpto (memName j) "mem" (.var "mm")`, the
  `CoverBlock.memCopy_spec` leaf shape at `memCopyK mm = 12·mm + 6` —
  composed with the landed member-driven engine
  `ScatterBlock.clearMem`, runs carrier-blind: equal clocks at
  carriers 100 and 200, exactly the member cells moved. NOT
  `copyCom`'s carrier-width copy: the fixed-`n` copy is one of the
  walks G2 kills.
* **Floor-death** (§6): with the member clause available, the §1
  order-text floor of `OrderBlockProbe` is escapable — the measured
  member-driven phase clock `phaseClockK` fits `orderCostA` read at
  the arena weight where the landed text's clock refutes it
  (`memPhase_escapes_floor`), the nested empty-charge floor is defused
  at the measured constant `12` (`#guard` at the `10¹¹` numerals of
  `emptyCharge_route_dead`), and the whole interface arithmetic closes
  at the measured constants by `G2ExistsRevalidation.g2m_exists`,
  cited and instantiated, not re-derived
  (`memPhase_interface_closes`).

/-! ## §1 The two proposed names

The `cpsName`/`cnumName` precedent (`RamDriver.lean:807/811`) at the
`alvName → "alv"` copy pattern: the per-depth name is the fixed engine
name plus the depth's numeral. -/

/-- The member list of the arena at depth `j`: the alive vertices of
`alvName j`, in strictly increasing order, in the first `mnumName j`
cells; the tail is junk. Fixed physical length `n` (E29: pre-allocated
once with the rest of `DepthMem`, never re-allocated). -/
def memName (j : ℕ) : String := "mem" ++ toString j

/-- The member count of depth `j`: the length of the live prefix. -/
def mnumName (j : ℕ) : String := "mm" ++ toString j

-- freshness against the copy targets: the per-depth names are not the
-- fixed engine names they copy into

  simp [memName, String.ext_iff]

/-! ## §2 The proposed clause, and why the `∃`-form loses nothing -/

/-- **The `DepthMem` delta**: the member array of every depth is there
at length `n`. In the real threading this is a 13th entry
`(memName j, n)` in `DepthMem`'s `Sized` list; stated standalone here
so no landed `Prop` is touched. -/
def DepthMemM (n : ℕ) (σ : Env) : Prop :=
  ∀ j : ℕ, ∃ g : ℕ → ℕ, σ.arrs (memName j) = arrOf n g

/-- **The proposed 16th clause of `LevelPre`** (appended, so the
positional `⟨h1, …⟩` destructurings repair by one added component): the
depth's member list enumerates the depth's own mask, existentially.

The four conjuncts: the array at its fixed length `n`, the count
scalar, `MemList` against `markSet n M` (sound, complete, strictly
increasing — `Refine/ScatterBlockProg.lean`'s contract), and the word
clause on the whole physical array (the live prefix is already below
`n < B`; the junk tail needs its own bound to survive re-statement, and
carries NO content clause — see `memClause_zero_carrier`). -/
def MemClause (B n j : ℕ) (M : ℕ → ℕ) (σ : Env) : Prop :=
  ∃ (Mem : ℕ → ℕ) (mmj : ℕ),
    σ.arrs (memName j) = arrOf n Mem ∧ σ.vars (mnumName j) = mmj ∧
    MemList n mmj Mem (markSet n M) ∧ ∀ z, z < n → Mem z < B

/-- **`LevelPre` with the member clause** — the proposed shape, stated
over the landed `LevelPre` without editing it. The real threading
appends `MemClause`'s body as clause 16 and puts `(memName j, n)` into
`DepthMem`'s list; `levelPre_run` gains `memName j ∉ c.warrs` and
`mnumName j ∉ c.wvars`. -/
def LevelPreM (B n cap mb ns W : ℕ) (O T : ℕ → ℕ) (j : ℕ) (M Gm : ℕ → ℕ)
    (C : ℕ → ℕ → ℕ) (σ : Env) : Prop :=
  LevelPre B n cap mb ns W O T j M Gm C σ ∧ DepthMemM n σ ∧ MemClause B n j M σ

/-- **The `∃`-packaging is lossless.** Two member lists of the same set
agree in count and, cell for cell, on the live prefix: a strictly
increasing sound-and-complete enumeration is unique. This is what lets
the clause ride inside `LevelPre` without new `LevelPre` parameters —
consumers that destructure the `∃` at two program points always
extract the same list. -/

/-! ## §3 Existence: driver-shaped machines inhabit the clause

The witness world is the two-vertex, zero-edge carrier: `n = 2`,
`ns = W = 0`, `cap = mb = 0`, `B = 4`. Every array of
`LevelMem`/`OrderMem`/`DepthMem` is present at its declared length —
the classifier `len2` says which — so the witness is a whole machine
memory, not a fragment. -/

/-- The declared length of every array name in the witness world
(`n = 2`, `W = 0`, `cap = 0`, `mb = 0`): the `xofName` family and the
`n + 1` scratch at 3, the `xmmName` family and `"xmem"` at `n·n = 4`,
`"path"` at `2·cap + 1 = 1`, the width-`W` arrays, `"wa"` and the
`klName` family at 0, everything else — including every per-depth family
and the `memName` family — at `n = 2`.

**Wave R1.8-T3-flip (a2).** The `klName` family joins `"wa"` in the
width-`mb` bucket, not the carrier one: the kill list of a depth is a
sub-list of the padded batch buffer's entries, so `DepthMem` sizes it at
`mb` and the witness world has `mb = 0`. -/

/-! ## §4 The producer, charged at the block — and the two negatives

The instrument is `TgtWidenProbe.execC`, the same cost-carrying
interpreter `OrderBlockProbe` §1 pinned the landed order text with.
The probe state is `CluScan`'s context at depth 0: the block CSR of
the current centre (`curName 0 = 1`, whose row holds the block), the
cluster indicator, and the child member array. The carrier enters only
through `clusterLoad`'s landed `fillCom` head — which is exactly the
per-turn carrier walk BlockLeaves' composed clear+load replaces (E4,
`blockLoadK`); the DELTA the emission adds must not, and does not,
read the carrier at all. -/

/-- **The pre-thread `clusterLoad`**, written out: the text the landed
one had before the E-mem thread put the emission inside its scan. The
landed `RamDriver.clusterLoad` *is* `clusterLoadM` now, so the delta the
design measured has to be measured against this baseline — otherwise the
`8·bs + 2` claim would silently read `0`. -/
def clusterLoadOld (j : ℕ) : Com :=
  .seq (fillCom (cluName j) (.lit 0))
    (.seq (Csr.loadRow (xofName j) (curName j) "p" "pend")

        (.seq (.store (cluName j) (.get (xmmName j) (.var "p")) (.lit 1))
          (.assign "p" (.add (.var "p") (.lit 1))))))

/-- `RamDriver.clusterLoad`, with the member-emission add-on: one store
and one counter bump inside the existing block scan. The raw block
list lands in the child's member array in emission order — the block
row's order — and `"bq"` counts it. Since the thread landed this is the
landed text itself (`clusterLoadM_eq`). -/

/-! ## §5 The consumer direction: the live-prefix copy convention

The engine-side wiring check: a level hands its member list to an
engine by copying the LIVE PREFIX into the fixed names `"mem"`/`"mm"`
(`ArenaA`'s convention, `Refine/ScatterBlock.lean:87-93`) — the
`CoverBlock.memCopy_spec` leaf at `memCopyK mm = 12·mm + 6`, NOT
`copyCom`'s fixed-`n` copy (that copy is itself a carrier walk; the
design doc's consumer table charges every copy at the member count).
The engine here is the landed member-driven clearing pass
`ScatterBlock.clearMem` (budget `clearMemK mm = 25·mm + 12`), reading
`"mem"`/`"mm"` — the composition is a wiring check on landed capital,
not a re-derivation. -/

/-! ## §6 Floor-death: the §1 order-text shape is escapable

`OrderBlockProbe` §1 compiled the landed order text's clock as affine
in the CARRIER (`+650·n` at `R = 0`) and refuted `orderCostA` read at
the arena weight `4`; its §2 no-escape theorem multiplied any
`Ω(n)` empty-arena charge into the root. With the member clause
available, both die at once: the member-driven phase's measured clock
(`OrderSigProbeM.phaseClockK m = 68·m + 12`, pinned on the tower's own
semantics at two carrier widths) FITS the same budget at the same
reading point, its empty-arena charge is the constant `12`, and the
full Σ-interface arithmetic at exactly these constants closes by
`G2ExistsRevalidation.g2m_exists` — cited, not re-derived. The
surviving carrier term of the landed budget (`orderPhaseCost`'s
`≈1600·n`-per-level class, `n²` nested — `C0Probe`'s floor) has no
analogue: nothing here reads the carrier. -/
