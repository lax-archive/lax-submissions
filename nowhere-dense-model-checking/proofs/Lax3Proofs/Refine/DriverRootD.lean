**The root, restated at the composed dedup'd decode** — ND-MC rebase,
B7 re-run leaf S2/S3.

The slot sweep (`Refine.SlotSweep`) left the landed root with six
blocking slots in three groups. This file kills the first two groups at
a *restated* root — `driverRootD`, whose decode phase is the composed
`decodeCom ; lwCom ; dedupCom` — and leaves the cost group
(#20/#22/#23/#27) exactly where the landed root has it: the restated
root keeps the landed cost hypothesis shapes, read at the compacted
slot count.

* **S2, the `"lw"` repair (finding 4).** `BridgeSeamProbe` §2–§4 proved
  the landed root's precondition `initEnv`-satisfiable iff the input
  word has no edges: `RamDriver.OrderMem`'s live-width clause reads
  `ns ≤ 0` at a fresh environment, no driver pass assigns `"lw"`, and a
  prologue cannot compute the value without consuming the tape
  (`read_breaks_inp`). The repair witness was landed there
  (`lwCom`/`lwCom_spec`, one assignment, cost `4`); what was missing is
  the phase that carries it. `decodeComD` splices `lwCom` between the
  decode and the dedup guard — right after `.read "m"`, where the slot
  count is live — and `DecodeImplementsDL` is the composed obligation
  whose *pre*condition asks `OrderMem B n 0 W` (satisfiable at
  `initEnv`) and whose *post*condition delivers
  `OrderMem B n (dedupNs x) W`. The anti-witness
  (`restated_pre_initEnv_where_landed_is_not`) is the exact converse of
  `rootPre_initEnv_iff_ns_zero`: at an edgeful word the restated
  precondition holds at a fresh environment while the landed one holds
  at none.

  **One consequence of the weakened entry, recorded.** The landed
  decode Specs (`RamDriverIO.decodeImplements`,
  `RamDriverDedup.decodeImplementsD`) demand `OrderMem B n ns W` —
  hence `ns ≤ lw` — *before* the decode, so neither can be entered from
  the repaired precondition at all: the brief's route
  "`decodeImplementsD` composed with `lwCom_spec`" does not typecheck
  at `lw = 0`. The decode walk is therefore replayed here once
  (`decode_spec_lw0`) with the live-width clause at `0` on both sides —
  the walk never reads `"lw"`, so the proof is the landed one with the
  index weakened; nothing else moves.

* **S3a, `driverRootD`.** `driverRootD_decides_sentence` (at `R = 0`)
  and `driverRootD_decides_sentenceR` (general `R`) restate
  `RamDriverRoot.driverRoot_decides_sentence` at the composed decode.
  The root's data triple becomes `dedupNs x / dedupOffset x /
  dedupTarget x`; **`hcsr` disappears** — its producer is
  `RamDriverDedup.csrSimple_dedup` (slot #6's kill, `slot06_dead_at_D`);
  `hO`/`hT`/`hpad0` die with it (the compacted triple is definitionally
  the data the phase leaves, and its tail is `dedupTarget_eq_zero`);
  `hKdec` covers `decodeCost n ns + dedupCost n ns + 4`; `ns ≤ W`
  becomes the explicit hypothesis `hnsW`, because the landed root read
  it off the precondition's `OrderMem ns` clause and the restated
  precondition carries `OrderMem 0`. Every other slot is byte-identical
  to the landed root's, read at the compacted count.

* **S3b, `levelAtR`.** The level assembly restated at general `R` with
  the ordering slot carrying the phase's degree export, so the root's
  every-permutation `hdeg` — the slot `SlotSweep` §C refutes at the
  stars — is **gone**.

  **A type-level finding first**: the brief's slot value
  `P := RamDriverCompose.OrderP R G M` cannot inhabit the frozen
  interface. `RamDriverCluster.levelImplements` binds `P` *before* the
  mask and reads `P π ord` at every `M`; `OrderP` names the mask. The
  admissible value is the mask-uniform degree bound
  `DegOrder n G cap Kmass` — the `R = R*` value
  `RamDriver.OrderImplements`' own docstring promises — which implies
  the per-arena bound at every mask (`wreach_masked_subset`, what
  `hmass` consumes) and which the per-π producer
  (`exists_wreachDeg_of_orderP`, at `OrderP`) closes at the all-alive
  root arena (`degOrder_of_orderP_alive`). Three named residuals are
  hypotheses, none dischargeable from today's capital at `R > 0`:

  * `horder`, the phase walk at the `DegOrder` slot value — the
    residual `RamDriverRoot`'s own `hdeg` section names, at the shape
    the frozen slot admits. **The landed `R`-round walk cannot feed
    even the per-obligation shape** (`no_guard_instance`): the E2b walk
    discharges `OrderImplementsRL`, whose precondition carries
    `chainWidthE … ≤ σ.vars "lw"`, and the slot holds only `LevelPre`,
    whose `OrderMem` pins no more than `ns ≤ lw` — while
    `chainWidthE > ns` always (`ns_lt_chainWidthE`). The `.pre` bridge
    is compiled anyway (`orderSlot_of_RL`) so the gap is a theorem and
    not prose: closing it means threading the width guard through
    `LevelPre` (or re-walking the phase), a landed-file wave this leaf
    does not own.
  * `hfr : RFrames …`, the nested driver's write-set facts at round
    `R` — `Lax3Proofs.RamDriverWrites` proves them at `R = 0` only
    (`rFrames_zero` is that plug), and the general-`R` write-set
    recursion is its own mechanical wave.
  * `hptr`/`hexit`, the arena-pointer word readings, in the frozen
    slots' own every-ordering shape: `levelAt` discharges them from
    the *unconditional* `hdeg`, and the conditional form cannot reach
    them, because `RamDriverCluster.levelImplements` hands the slots
    `RamCover.OrdersBy` alone — the `P π ord` witness is in scope at
    their one use site but not passed. F-c-3 threaded `P` into `hmass`
    and not into W2's pointer slots; carrying it there is a one-line
    landed-file change this leaf does not own.

* **The compiled kills** (§6): `slot06_dead_at_D` (#6),
  `slot26_dead_at_R` with its control `not_orderP_starLast_id` (#26),
  `slot12_hB_nondegenerate` (#12), and
  `restated_pre_initEnv_where_landed_is_not` (finding 4). The landed
  sweep theorems (`slot06_hcsr_blocked`, `slot26_hdeg_blocked`,
  `wordBound_of_deg_slot`, `rootPre_initEnv_iff_ns_zero`) are untouched
  and remain true of the landed root.

/-! ## §1 The decode at the free live width

`RamDriverIO.decodeImplements` — and with it
`RamDriverDedup.decodeImplementsD` — carries `RamDriver.OrderMem B n ns W`
in its *pre*condition, whose live-width clause `ns ≤ σ.vars "lw"` is
exactly what `BridgeSeamProbe` proved unreachable from `initEnv`. The
walk itself never reads the scalar: the landed proof consumes the clause
only to hand it back across the run's frame. `decode_spec_lw0` is that
walk with the clause weakened to the satisfiable index `0` on both
sides. It is the landed proof of `decodeImplements`, instantiated at
`O := offset x`, `T := padTarget x ns`, with the live-width index
dropped to `0` — no step is new. -/

/-! ## §4 The level assembly at general `R`

`RamDriverRoot.levelAt` instantiates
`RamDriverCluster.levelImplements` at `R = 0` with the ordering slot at
`True`. `levelAtR` is the same instantiation at general `R` with the
slot at `RamDriverCompose.OrderP R G M`, so the cover-degree hypothesis
`hdeg` is consumed in its per-π conditional form — the shape
`RamDriverRoot.exists_wreachDeg_of_orderP` produces on a nowhere dense
class. Two residuals become hypotheses; each is a fact about landed
program text, each has its `R = 0` plug check here, and neither has a
general-`R` producer today (see the module header). -/

recursion) lands without touching the assembly again. -/

`RamDriverCluster.levelImplements` binds its slot `P` *before* the mask

`OrderP` names the mask. That is the compiled shape of the F-c-3
threading gap — the per-mask bundle fits the per-obligation
`OrderImplementsR`, and does not fit the level induction's slot. On the
graph the bound *implies* the per-arena bound at every mask

/-- **Every level of the driver at general `R`** — `RamDriverRoot.levelAt`
with the ordering slot at `RamDriverCompose.OrderP R G M`.

Deltas from `levelAt`, and nothing else moves: the ordering slot is
`DegOrder n G cap Kmass` — the mask-uniform `R*` slot value (see its
docstring: `OrderP R G M` cannot inhabit the slot, whose `P` binds
before the mask) — so the every-permutation `hdeg` hypothesis is
**gone**, subsumed by the slot: `hmass` reads the degree off the
phase's own export, through `wreach_masked_subset` at the level's
mask. `horder` is the `R`-round phase walk at that slot value (the
named residual — see the module header for why the landed
`OrderImplementsRL` walk cannot feed the slot's bare-`LevelPre` shape);
`hfr` is the round-`R` write-set residual; `hKo` reads the phase budget
at `orderPhaseCostR`. The hypothesis list is otherwise byte-identical
to `levelAt`'s — except for one more residual this restatement
*exposes*:

**`hptr`/`hexit`, the arena-pointer word slots, resurface as
hypotheses.** `levelAt` discharges them from the unconditional `hdeg`
(`ArenaPointer.ptrWords_of_mass`/`massWords_of_mass`). The frozen
`RamDriverCluster.levelImplements` quantifies both slots over *every*
ordering with only `RamCover.OrdersBy` in hand — its own proof uses
them exactly at the phase-produced ordering, where the `P π ord`
witness is in scope one line earlier, but the slot does not pass it —
so no slot-conditional degree can feed them. F-c-3 threaded `P` through
`hmass` and not through W2's two pointer slots; until the cluster file
carries `P π ord` beside `OrdersBy` there (a landed-file wave), the
readings stay hypotheses here, in the frozen slots' own shape. -/

/-! ### The RL bridge, and why it is vacuous today

The route from the landed `R`-round walk
(`RamDriverCompose.orderImplementsR`, which discharges
`OrderImplementsRL`) to any bare-`LevelPre` phase obligation — the
per-obligation `OrderImplementsR` below, and `levelAtR`'s `horder`
alike — is a `.pre` step: the RL Spec carries the extra precondition
conjunct `chainWidthE n ns d D₁ R ≤ σ.vars "lw"`, and the bare
precondition must imply it. `LevelPre`'s `OrderMem` pins exactly
`ns ≤ lw ≤ W`, so the only bridging hypothesis expressible there is
`chainWidthE … ≤ ns` — and that is **false at every instance**
(`ns_lt_chainWidthE`): `chainWidthE` is `n·(budget+1)² + ns + 1`. The
bridge is compiled (`orderSlot_of_RL`) so the fit is checkable, and its
hypothesis's unsatisfiability is compiled beside it
(`no_guard_instance`) so the residual is a theorem: feeding the landed
`R`-walk through the frozen slot shape needs the width guard *inside*
`LevelPre` (or a re-walked phase), not a weakening. -/

/-- **The restated root at `R = 0`** —
`RamDriverRoot.driverRoot_decides_sentence` at the composed decode,
fully discharged from landed capital (the level leg is `levelAt` at the
compacted triple).

Diff from the landed root, slot for slot: the precondition's `OrderMem`
index is `0` and `DedupMem` is added (finding 4); **`hcsr` is gone** —
produced by `csrSimple_dedup`; `hO`/`hT`/`hpad0` are gone — the
compacted triple is the phase's own data and `dedupTarget_eq_zero` its
tail; `hnsW : ns ≤ W` is explicit (the landed root read it off the
precondition's `OrderMem ns`); `hKdec` covers the composed phase; the
level-facing slots read the compacted count `dedupNs x` where the
landed root's read `ns`, and are otherwise byte-identical in shape and
order; the cost is `Kdec + (Kl 0 (n + dedupNs x) + Ksent)`. The
program is `driverRootD` in place of `driverRoot`. `hdeg` stays in the
landed unconditional form — at `R = 0` the ordering slot is `True` and
slot #26 blocks exactly as the sweep records; its kill is the
general-`R` sibling below. -/

/-! ### #6 `hcsr` is dead at the restated root

Structurally: `driverRootD_decides_sentence` *has no* `CsrSimple`
hypothesis — the slot's producer is `csrSimple_dedup`, consumed inside
the proof. The sweep's obstruction and the restated root's data meet at
one witness below: the very word at which the landed slot is refuted
carries the compacted triple's `CsrSimple`. -/

/-- **Slot #6, killed.** At the sweep's own witness the landed root's
`hcsr` reading is false and the restated root's reading holds — the same
graph, the two triples. -/

/-! ### #26 `hdeg` is dead at the restated slot shape

`SlotSweep` §C: the landed slot quantifies over *every* permutation,
and at `starLast n` with the centre ordered last it forces
`n ≤ Kmass` — so no constant chosen before the instance serves
(`slot26_hdeg_blocked`, untouched). The restated slot demands the bound
only at orderings carrying `RamDriverCompose.OrderP`, and the chain
bundle *excludes* the adversarial ordering: at `R = 0` the bundle
degenerates to the two elimination bounds
(`CoverDegree.augChainData_zero`), the sub-star's elimination form of
degeneracy is `1` (`lowDegreeVertices_substar`), so any `OrderP`-carrying
ordering has back-degree `1` at every vertex — and then every weakly
reachable set has at most three elements, at **every** radius. The flip
is `slot26_dead_at_R`: a constant (`3`) chosen before `n` satisfies the
restated slot shape on the whole star family, the C0 quantifier order
the sweep's `¬∃` refutes for the landed shape. The negative control
`not_orderP_starLast_id` checks the guard is doing the work: the
sweep's own refuting tuple — the identity ordering — carries no
`OrderP`. -/

/-! ### #12 `hB` follows: the word bound no longer degenerates

`SlotSweep.wordBound_of_deg_slot` (untouched, still true): where the
degree slot forces `n ≤ Kmass`, `WordBoundK` collapses to the retired
carrier bound and `BridgeSeamProbe.no_word_size_for_sparse` kills the
bridge again. At the restated slot the producer's constant is
`⌈c · n^δ⌉₊` with `c` and `δ < 1` chosen before `n` — and past a
threshold of the two, that is *below* `n`, so the collapse's hypothesis
fails at every large instance and `WordBoundK` stays the almost-linear
bound `Refine.BridgeCrossing` crossed. -/
