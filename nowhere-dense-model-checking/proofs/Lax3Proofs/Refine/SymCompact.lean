# ND-MC G2/E2-sym — the compacted-arena symmetrization

The third engine family of `g2-cost-design` §6, on the template
`Refine/ElimCompact.lean` §9 wrote for it. `Refine/OrderEngineProbe.lean`
is the warrant: its coupling table's **first and fourth rows** are the
*restore-seam*, and both are `symCom`'s —

> `mcopyPass … off/tgt` (saves 1–2) | `saveCsr` | restore-seam: `symCom`
> writes `off[0..n]`/`tgt` carrier-wide, so the saved prefix must be the

>
> `mcopyPass` restores (6–7) | `restoreCsr` | restore-seam: after
> `symCom` the non-member cells of `off` hold the arena structure's
> offsets, not the level's

This file kills that class. `symCom`'s offset pass is
`fillUpto "off" (.add (.var "n") (.lit 1)) …` — a **carrier** fill only
because the carrier scalar says so. Run at carrier `mm` it is a
`mm+1`-cell fill: a *prefix* write of the compact view, and the level's
dead rows above the prefix come back untouched, with no save and no
restore pass at all. §2.2 compiles that against the landed pass on the
same store (which erases a sentinel the compacted composite hands back
cell for cell), and §4 proves it (`ElimCompact.tail_preserved` at the
schedule `symClen`).

## What the wave had to discover, and did not have to do

`RamDriver.symCom` is **carrier-parametric**, exactly as
`RamElim.elimCom` was: its three passes are `RamAugment.outPass` (three
`forVerts`, all `.lt (.var "i") (.var "n")`), the offset `fillUpto` at
`.add (.var "n") (.lit 1)`, and `RamAugment.forVerts symRow`. Its landed
walk `RamDriverAugment.symPass_run` is a **theorem**, not an obligation,
and it quantifies over that carrier. So "symmetrize at carrier `mm`"
needs no re-synthesis whatever: set `"n" := mm` and apply `symPass_run`
at `n := mm`. No heartbeat ceiling was spent in this file.

What stands in the way is the same *length seam* the elimination met,
and `ElimCompact` §3 closed it generically in the semantics
(`bigStepB_padArrs`, `run_of_run_cutArrs`, `tail_preserved`). This file
imports those verbatim and supplies only its own three pieces, exactly as
the template predicted: a length schedule (`symClen`), a live-prefix
entry surface (`SymPreC`), and one `elimPreW_cutArrs`-shaped lemma
(`symPreC_cutArrs`).

## The contract

`symCom` has no member-indexed output: what it produces is the compact
undirected CSR that the *next compacted elimination* reads out of
`off`/`tgt`, so there is no scatter-back in this family (§9.3 of the
template: "a sibling reuses `compactPass` and `installCom` unchanged and
supplies its own scatter-back **if its outputs are not ranks**"). Its
restated contract `SymMemPost` is therefore already carrier-free — the
subject is an `Orientation mm` and the block structure is read on the
compact prefix — and §6 proves the restatement is an **equivalence** with
the landed reading at `mm = n`, not a weakening.

## What is *not* here

One walk is isolated as a named obligation in §7: `SymPreps`, that the
three preparation passes move the compact in-lists into the pass's input
arrays and zero the counting sort's accumulator over the compact prefix.
It is refuted-before-proved on data in §2.3 and stated once. The
*carrier-setting* half — the two assignments that make `symCom`'s three
loops arena-bounded, which is where "run at carrier `mm`" actually
happens — is **walked here** (`symSetCarrier_spec`), not assumed.

Nothing in this file is `sorry`, and no theorem assumes `SymPreps` except
`symCompact_spec`, which names it as a hypothesis.

/-! ## §1 The program

Four passes and one `Com`. Every bound is `"mm"` or the compact in-list
slot counter `"kd"`; the carrier scalar `"n"` occurs in exactly two
places — the save `"kn" := n` and the install `n := mm` — and the second
is what makes `symCom`'s own three loops arena-bounded.

The cell discipline is the wave's own prefix (`"kn"` the saved carrier,
`"kd"` the compact arc count) plus the landed pass's own names, so no
landed scalar is disturbed. -/

/-- **The compact orientation into the pass's input arrays.** The
compacted elimination (`ElimCompact`) leaves its in-lists in
`ioff`/`itg` *in the compact numbering* — that file's §5 note records
that this is deliberate, because every consumer downstream is compacted
too. This is the phase's own relink (`copyUpto "ioff" "doff"
(.add (.var "n") (.lit 1))`, `copyUpto "itg" "dtg" (.var "lw")`) with
both bounds moved to the arena: `mm + 1` offsets and `kd` slots.

`OrderEngineProbe`'s coupling table row 3 refuted the *member* form of
these two copies (the read-seam: `symCom` reads `doff` at every carrier
vertex). Here they are prefix copies and the reads are at carrier `mm`,
so there is no non-member cell to read. -/
def symRelink : Com :=
  .seq (copyUpto "ioff" "doff" (.add (.var "mm") (.lit 1)))
    (copyUpto "itg" "dtg" (.var "kd"))

/-- **The counting sort's accumulator, zeroed over the compact prefix.**
`RamAugment.outPass` — which `symCom` opens with — accumulates the
out-degrees into `ooff` and so asks for it zeroed. The landed phase
zeroes it carrier-wide (`fillUpto "ooff" (.add (.var "n") (.lit 1))`, in
`orderZeroCom` and `augRelinkCom`); here the fill is `mm + 1` cells.
This is `OrderEngineProbe` §2's zero-seam with nothing to catch: the
re-zero is arena-class, and it is a *prefix* fill rather than a member
scatter, so no cell above the prefix is left stale. -/
def symZero : Com := fillUpto "ooff" (.add (.var "mm") (.lit 1)) (.lit 0)

/-- The three preparation passes. -/
def symPrepCom : Com := .seq symRelink symZero

/-- **The carrier, moved to the arena.** The saved carrier and the
install. Two assignments, and they are the whole of "the engine runs at
carrier `mm`" — this is the pass that is *walked* below
(`symSetCarrier_spec`) rather than assumed. -/
def symSetCarrier : Com := .seq (.assign "kn" (.var "n")) (.assign "n" (.var "mm"))

/-- **The compacted symmetrization, core**: prepare, install the carrier,
run the landed pass. What comes out in `off`/`tgt` is the compact
undirected CSR of the orientation's own graph, on the prefix `[0, mm]` of
the level's offset array and the prefix `[0, 2m)` of its target array —
and nothing above either prefix moves. -/
def symCompactCore : Com := .seq symPrepCom (.seq symSetCarrier symCom)

/-- **…and with the carrier scalar put back**, for a caller that needs
`"n"` as it handed it over. There is nothing else to restore: §2.2 and
§4 are the statement that the level's own `off`/`tgt` come back above the
compact prefix by themselves. -/

in-lists `ioff`/`itg` of a five-member arena inside a carrier of any
size, with a **sentinel** above every compact prefix. -/

The sentinel `7` sits above every compact prefix; the composite must hand

`mm + 1` cells and the row copies stop at slot `2m`. That is the whole of
the restore: there is **no save and no restore pass at all**. -/

/-! ## §5 The contract at the compacted arena

`OrderEngineProbe` §5 compiled that the *phase*'s postcondition is
carrier-sized and that no engine repair can change that. This section is
the symmetrization's own half of the move: the pass's contract, restated
so that nothing in it ranges over the carrier.

The subject is an `Orientation mm` — the compacted arena's own
orientation, or an augmentation of it — and the block structure is read
on the compact prefix of the level's offset array, `getD`-style, exactly
as `ElimCompact.ElimMemPost` reads the in-lists. There is no `∀ v < n`:
that is the whole point. -/

/-- **The symmetrization's contract, at the compacted arena.** The
compact undirected CSR of `D.toGraph`, on the prefix `[0, mm]` of the
offset array and in the target array at the caller's width, with the
target array's own tail above the slot count preserved.

This is what the *second* compacted elimination reads: `ElimCompact`'s
`ElimPreC` asks for `off` as `arrOf (n+1) g` with `∀ i ≤ mm, g i = O i`
and `tgt` as `arrOf nt T`, which is this postcondition's `O`/`T`. -/
def SymMemPost (mm nt m : ℕ) (D : Orientation mm) (T₀ : ℕ → ℕ) (σ' : Env) : Prop :=
  ∃ O T : ℕ → ℕ,
    (∀ i, i ≤ mm → (σ'.arrs "off").getD i 0 = O i) ∧

    CsrSimple D.toGraph (m + m) O T ∧
    (∀ z, m + m ≤ z → z < nt → T z = T₀ z)

/-- **The arena reading.** When the orientation symmetrized is one of the
compacted arena itself — which is what `ElimCompact.ElimMemPost`'s
`E.toGraph = memGraph G M hml` clause delivers at `R = 0` — the compact
CSR the pass leaves is a CSR of the compacted arena, and every quantifier
of the statement ranges over `Fin mm`. -/
theorem symMemPost_memGraph {n mm nt m : ℕ} {G : SimpleGraph (Fin n)} {M Mem : ℕ → ℕ}

/-! ## §6 The bridge to the landed reading

The wave's contract is a restatement, so it owes the statement that it
*is* one. At `mm = n` — the all-alive arena at the identity numbering —
`SymMemPost` is the landed conclusion of `symPass_run`, clause for clause
and in **both directions**: this is an equivalence, not a weakening. -/

/-- **The bridge.** At the carrier the member reading of the offsets is
the landed `arrOf (n+1) O` reading, and conversely. So §5 weakens
nothing. -/

/-! ## §7 The composite

One named obligation (`SymPreps`, §2.3's compiled content), one walked
pass (`symSetCarrier_spec` — the carrier install, which is where "run at
carrier `mm`" happens), and §4's transported engine. -/

/-! ### §7.0 What a discharger of `SymPreps` needs

The kit is landed and the arithmetic closes, which is why this is an
obligation and not a gap: `RamDriverOrder.copyKeep_spec` and
`fillKeep_spec` — the live-prefix half of the flat-pass kit, whose
postconditions carry the *tail-kept* clause this obligation's
live-prefix reading needs — apply once per pass at
`(N, Nd) = (mm+1, n+1)`, `(kd, W)`, `(mm+1, n+1)`, with the invariant
`Q τ := τ.vars "n" = n ∧ τ.vars "mm" = mm ∧ τ.vars "kd" = kd ∧
τ.arrs "ioff" = arrOf (n+1) IOg ∧ τ.arrs "itg" = arrOf W ITg` (each pass
writes a different array and only the scalar `"i"`, so `hQfr` is
immediate). The three costs are `14·(mm+1) + 8`, `12·kd + 6` and
`13·(mm+1) + 8`, i.e. `27·mm + 12·kd + 49`, inside
`symPrepCost mm kd = 100·mm + 100·kd + 100` with room. -/

/-- **The composite's entry**: the compact in-lists as the compacted
elimination leaves them, the pass's five scratch arrays at the carrier's
physical lengths, and the level's own offset and target arrays. -/
def SymEntryC (n mm nt W kd : ℕ) (IO IT T₀ : ℕ → ℕ) (σ : Env) : Prop :=
  σ.vars "n" = n ∧ σ.vars "mm" = mm ∧ σ.vars "kd" = kd ∧ mm ≤ n ∧ kd ≤ W ∧
  (∃ g, σ.arrs "ioff" = arrOf (n + 1) g ∧ ∀ i ≤ mm, g i = IO i) ∧
  (∃ g, σ.arrs "itg" = arrOf W g ∧ ∀ j < kd, g j = IT j) ∧
  (∃ g, σ.arrs "doff" = arrOf (n + 1) g) ∧ (∃ g, σ.arrs "dtg" = arrOf W g) ∧
  (∃ g, σ.arrs "ooff" = arrOf (n + 1) g) ∧ (∃ g, σ.arrs "ofl" = arrOf n g) ∧
  (∃ g, σ.arrs "otg" = arrOf W g) ∧ (∃ g, σ.arrs "off" = arrOf (n + 1) g) ∧
  σ.arrs "tgt" = arrOf nt T₀

/-- The preparation budget: arena-affine, carrier-free. -/
def symPrepCost (mm kd : ℕ) : ℕ := 100 * mm + 100 * kd + 100

/-- **Obligation E2-s/1 — the preparation walk.** `symPrepCom` moves the
compact in-lists into the pass's input arrays and zeroes the counting
sort's accumulator over the compact prefix, at `symPrepCost`, leaving the
pass's live-prefix entry surface and touching no cell above the compact
prefixes.

Refutable, and refuted-before-proved on data in §2.3: without the relink
the pass symmetrizes the sentinel, and without the zero the counting sort
accumulates on top of it — both compiled as failures of the arena's own
offsets.

The four antecedents are the word bounds a *copy* needs and nothing more:
`Expr.evalB` refuses a value reaching `B` at every subterm, so a copy of a
cell holding `B` or more has no derivation at all and the obligation
without them would be false rather than merely hard.
`prep_bounds_of_inCsr` supplies the last two from the block structure
itself, at `kd = m`. -/
def SymPreps (B n mm nt W kd : ℕ) : Prop :=
  ∀ (IO IT T₀ : ℕ → ℕ) (σ : Env), mm + 1 < B → kd < B →

      σ'.vars "n" = n ∧ σ'.vars "mm" = mm ∧
      σ'.arrs "dtg" = arrOf W DT ∧ (∀ j < kd, DT j = IT j) ∧

      (∃ g, σ'.arrs "off" = arrOf (n + 1) g) ∧
      σ'.arrs "tgt" = arrOf nt T₀ ∧ ActiveZeroTail mm σ σ'

/-- **The two word bounds a preparation copy needs, from the block
structure itself.** An in-list offset of an `m`-slot structure is at most
`m`, and a slot target is a vertex of the compact arena — so at `kd = m`,
which is what the phase's relink copies, the caller of `SymPreps` (and of
`AugCompact.AugPreps`) has both antecedents for free. -/

/-- **The carrier install, walked.** Two assignments: the carrier saved
and the arena's vertex count put in its place. This is the whole of "the
engine runs at carrier `mm`", and it is proved, not assumed — the
`SymPreC` surface it produces is `symCompact_engine`'s precondition.

The one side condition is a word bound on the two scalars, which the
caller has from `mm ≤ n < B`. -/

/-! ## §8 What this family did *not* need

For the record, against the template's checklist (`ElimCompact` §9):

1. §3's semantics **imported verbatim** — `padArrs`, `cutArrs`,
   `tailOf`, `run_of_run_cutArrs`, `tail_preserved`, `take_arrOf`,
   `arrOf_congr`. Nothing about IMP+ is re-proved here.
2. **No re-synthesis.** `symCom`'s three passes are `"n"`-bounded and
   `symPass_run` is a theorem; the walk applies at `n := mm`.
3. **No scatter-back**, because the pass's output is a block structure
   and not a per-vertex answer: its consumer — the second compacted
   elimination — reads `off`/`tgt` at carrier `mm`.
4. **No save and no restore.** This is the family's own finding, and it
   is the sharpest form of the template's item 4: because every write is
   a prefix write of the compact view (§4, `symCompact_tail`), the
   level's own block structure needs no `saveCsr`/`restoreCsr` pair
   around this pass at all. `OrderEngineProbe` §3's restore-seam is not
   repaired here — it is *removed*.
5. **The mask clause is not re-authorised**, because `symCom` does not
   read `alv`: `masked_of_all_alive` is not needed in this family. The
   pass that follows it in the phase text (`fillCom "alv" (.lit 1)`)
   becomes `fillUpto "alv" (.var "mm") (.lit 1)` in the compacted design
   — arena-class, and `ElimCompact.installCom` already carries exactly
   that fill. -/
