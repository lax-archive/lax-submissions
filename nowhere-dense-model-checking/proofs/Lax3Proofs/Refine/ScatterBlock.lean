# The active-set greedy scatter pass

The engine itself: one turn of the member scan, the scan, and the whole
pass. The program is in `ScatterBlockProg.lean`, the charge in
`ScatterBlockCost.lean`, the two loop walks in `ScatterBlockMark.lean`
and `ScatterBlockClear.lean`, and the strengthened block search in
`ScatterBlockBfs.lean`.

**The export is the landed postcondition, character for character.**
`RamScatter.scatter_spec` leaves in `flag` the truth value of the
scatter sentence and says `flag ≤ 1`; so does `scatBlock_spec`. Nothing
downstream sees the difference, which is the point: the atom's answer is
unchanged and only its charge moves, from `scatterCost n ns t` to
`scatBlockK mm bw nb t`.

### What a turn does differently

The landed turn stands at a carrier cell and asks three questions — is
there room, is this cell in the table, is it unexcluded. The active turn
stands at a *member* and asks two, because the first question is
answered by the list it is walking. The invariant is nevertheless
carried at a **carrier** position, `memPos`, so that the landed
recursion `gsel_iff` — which quantifies over all earlier vertices, not
all earlier members — applies verbatim. `progressA_step_gap` is what
moves the invariant from one member to the next across the vertices in
between, and it is sound because everything the process selects is a
member.

### The two charges a pick pays

A pick runs the block search and then marks its ball. Both are charged
to the ball and neither mentions the carrier, but that is only true
because `ScatterBlockBfs.bfsBlockA_specW` re-exports two facts that
`BfsBlock.bfsBlock_spec` computes and drops — that a queue entry is a
vertex, and that the queue is no longer than the ball. Without the
second, the mark walk would be charged `tail ≤ n`, and the carrier term
this whole wave exists to remove would walk straight back in through the
marking pass. See that file's header.

/-! ### §1 The arena the active pass carries

Three differences from `RamScatter.Arena`: the member count and the
member list are in it, the table array is not, and the distance array is
required *clean*. The last is `BfsBlock`'s clean-in/clean-out contract
lifted to the pass — the pass is handed a clean `dist`, every pick
returns it clean, and the pass hands it back clean.

**The member array is at the carrier's physical length** (rebase F-2,
the length seam). The driver pre-allocates one member array per depth at
`n` cells and fills a live prefix of `mnumName j` of them
(`RamDriver.LevelPre`'s sixteenth clause; the engine entry copies that
prefix into `"mem"` at `CoverBlock.memCopyK mm = 12·mm + 6`). So the
arena pins `σ.arrs "mem" = arrOf n Mem` and not `arrOf mm Mem`: the
physical length is the carrier's, the *contract* is `MemList`'s, and
`MemList` speaks only of `k < mm`. Nothing above the live prefix is
claimed, read, or cleared — a tail clause here would be exactly the
carrier walk the whole variant exists to remove. The walks below index
the array only through `Mem k` for `k < mm`, so every read is in range
by `MemList.card_le`, and no proof of this file needs the tail.
`Refine/ArenaSeam.lean` is the driver-side discharge of the two member
clauses. -/

/-! ### §3 What the mark decides

The landed marking sweep reads the distance array and excludes every
vertex it finds within `r`. The ball walk marks the queue segment and
the source. These are the same set, and this is the lemma that says so.

The two directions are the two ways a vertex can fail to be on the
queue: it is the source, which the search writes but never enqueues when
it is dead; or it is out of range, and then it is not within `r` either.
`alive_of_wd` is what closes the second — a walk that arrives anywhere
but its own start arrives at a live vertex, so a live-ball membership
test is no weaker than a distance test. -/

/-! ### §4 One turn of the member scan

The three control-flow paths a turn has: the count is already enough; an
earlier pick excluded this member; or the member is selected, and then
one block search and one ball walk pay for it. The landed turn had a
fourth — the table said no — and it is gone, because the list is the
table.

Nothing is claimed about the cost beyond the two cases the potential
needs. -/

/-! ### §5 The scan

The loop rule is the kit's `Spec.while_potential`: a turn that picks
draws on the first term of the potential and a turn that does not draws
on the second, so the whole scan costs one ball per pick and a constant
per **member**. -/

/-- The invariant of the active scan. The position the invariant is read
at is `memPos`, a *carrier* position, while the counter counts members —
that mismatch is the whole design, and `progressA_step_gap` is what
bridges it. -/

Clear, scan, report. The reporting limb is the landed one and the answer
it reports is the landed answer. -/

/-- **The active-set greedy scatter pass.** Handed a block structure for
`G`, a mask, the member list of `X`, a clean distance array, a radius
and a threshold, `scatBlockCom r t` leaves in `flag` the truth value of
the scatter sentence: `1` exactly when the greedy `r`-scattered subset
of `X` in the masked arena has at least `t` elements.

The postcondition is `RamScatter.scatter_specW`'s, verbatim. The charge
is `scatBlockK mm bw nb t`, in which **neither `n` nor `ns` occurs**. -/

/-! ### §6b The arena at a named mask array

The seventh clause of `ArenaA` is the only one that names the mask, and
`ArenaAt` is that clause moved to a parameter. Everything else is
`ArenaA` character for character — which is what makes the bridge below
one `simp` and not a second walk.

**What the bridge says.** `renEnv (maskSwap av) σ` is the environment
that answers "what is in `alv`?" with `σ`'s `av`, and answers every
other array question with `σ`'s own — provided the name asked about is
neither `"alv"` nor `av`, which for the six other arrays of the arena is
exactly `MaskFree av`. So the landed arena *at the pulled-back
environment* is the parameterised arena at the real one, and
`renCom_spec` turns the landed engine into an engine that reads `av`. -/
