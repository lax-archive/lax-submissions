**The kill pass, walked** — wave R1.8-T2, the machine half.

`RamDriverCluster.KillStep` is the obligation; this file discharges it.
`RamDriver.killCom` is the base case's *row body* — the straight line of
`RamDriver.botCom` fragments of a depth's table, one store apiece — run
at the entries of the turn's padded batch buffer instead of at a carrier
counter, and guarded on the kill test. So there is one new walk (the
buffer loop and its accumulating invariant), one line of mathematics, and
one frame.

# §1 The mathematics: the row of a killed vertex

`bot_spec` leaves the **edgeless** reading. `RamDriver.TableInv` at depth
`j + 1` asks for the reading in the child arena `masked G Alv'`. At a
vertex the child mask kills those are the same question —
`Refine.DeadRow.sat_bot_of_dead₁` — and the pointwise clause of
`RamDriverCluster.BatchData` (wave R1.8-T1) is what says the guard picks
out killed vertices: an entry of the buffer lies in the batch `W`, so
`M v ≠ 0 ∧ v ∈ X` gives `Alv' v = 0` there. That is the whole of §1, and
it is the reason the pass must run **after** `colourCom`: the reading is
at the child palette, and writing the parent's rows would be a silent
semantic error no cost probe catches.

# §2 The walk: an accumulating invariant over the buffer

The loop's invariant is *every entry already passed that the guard
accepted has its row*, and the body must therefore not disturb the rows
already written. So the fold's specification below is **pointwise in the
cell** — the row at the entry is the bit, and every other cell of every
table comes back — which `RamDriverBot.base_block_spec`'s prefix
invariant cannot give (it speaks about the cells *below* a counter, and
the buffer's entries are in no order at all).

The padding repeats the buffer's first entry, and the guard's verdict and
the row's content are both functions of the vertex alone, so re-killing
writes the same row: `killTurn_spec`'s postcondition is what makes the
repetition harmless rather than an argument in prose.

# §3 The frame

The pass writes the child depth's tables, the evaluator's scratch, and
its own two scalars `"kk"`/`"kv"`. Every name a level or a turn holds is
a depth-family name whose first character is not `b`, hence not an
extension of `"bb"`, is not a `tabName`, and carries a digit, hence is
neither of the two literals. So the whole frame is character arithmetic
on names, exactly as in `Refine.DeadSweep`, and the write-set lemmas it
runs on are `RamDriverWrites.warrs_killCom`/`wvars_killCom`.

# §4 Cost

`killCost` is `(blockCost + 17 + 4) · mb + 6`: **carrier-blind** — `n`
does not occur — and linear in the buffer's width `mb`, which is the
formula-sized `ℓ · (2·cap + 1)`. It rides the turn's own size slot
(design §7, disposition F-4), where the probe measured the same law at
`(3·t + 20)·kills + 6` (`Refine.DeadRowProbe.killTurnCom`). §5 below is
the arithmetic, checked in both directions.

The fold, pointwise in the cell. Three clauses: every cell but the
entry's comes back, the entry's cell holds the bit at every table the
fold has passed, and the entry's cell comes back at every table it has
not. The third is what lets the induction put the head's own table back
together after the tail has run. -/

/-- **The kill pass at the surface the turn consumes it at.**
`RamDriverCluster.KillStep`, from `killCom_spec` and the frame.

The mathematics is one rewrite: the pass leaves the *edgeless* reading,
and at a vertex the child mask kills that is the reading in the child
arena (`Refine.DeadRow.sat_bot_of_dead₁`). Which vertices those are is
`BatchData`'s pointwise clause, wave R1.8-T1's export: an entry of the
buffer lies in the batch, so the guard's `M v ≠ 0 ∧ v ∈ X` gives
`Alv' v = 0`. Everything else is names. -/

/-! ### §4 The bridge the level induction consumes

`Refine.DeadRowProbe.readback_dead_read_is_kill` compiles that every
dead vertex the readback consults is a kill of the turn that is
consulting it. Here that observation is closed against the rows the pass
actually wrote: the readback's whole input at depth `j + 1` is the alive
half — what the nested level establishes — plus the kill rows — what the
enclosing turn wrote before the call. This is the statement wave R1.8-T3
re-domains `RamDriver.TableInv` against; nothing above consumes it yet,
which is why it is stated and not threaded. -/

/-! ### §5 The cost, both directions

`killCost` is `(blockCost + 21) · mb + 6`. It is **carrier-blind** by
construction — `n` is not among its arguments, which is the compiled form
of `Refine.DeadRowProbe.killTurnCom`'s measured invariance at carriers
100 and 200 — and the checks below pin the rest of the law in both
directions: linear in the buffer's width, linear in the row's own size
class, and **not** coverable by a smaller per-entry coefficient. The last
pair is the absorption of design §7's disposition F-4: the turn
coefficient `ct = 284` covers BlockLeaves' measured `200` plus this
pass's charge at the probe's instance, and `274` does not. -/
