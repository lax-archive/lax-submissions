# `g2_exists`, re-validated against the two substrates that moved

`Refine/G2CostProbe.lean`'s existence probe was compiled against the
**pre-P4.5** tower cost model and against phase budgets read at an
abstract arena weight. Two things have moved under it since:

1. **the space substrate (P4.5, ledger E25–E29/E41).** Allocation is
   O(1) (bump pointer), deallocation is LIFO, and the binding law is
   the E41 **iff**: a descending driver's peak is `setup + levels·aw`,
   and it fits a word length linear in `|x|` *exactly when* `levels·aw`
   is linear in `|x|` (`SpaceBudget.nested_fits_iff`,
   `SpaceBudget.no_word_size_for_nested`). Per-turn fresh allocation is
   budget-fatal and touched-only reset is the loop-interior discipline;
   neither is re-derived here — both are consumed.

2. **the time shape of a phase (P4.6, wave M).**
   `Refine/OrderSigProbeM.lean` **measured** a member-driven order phase
   on the tower's own executable semantics: `phaseClockK m = 68·m + 12`,
   with the carrier `n` ABSENT and the empty-member charge the constant
   `12`. The re-derived order/cover/dead phases will therefore carry
   costs of the shape `a·m + b` at member count `m` — not the landed
   size-blind `orderPhaseCost n ns W`.

The campaign's standing rule is *compiled costs both directions*: before
a re-derivation wave family launches, the closed-form `Kl` must be shown
to **satisfy** the proposed side conditions at the target shape, not
merely to escape the old floors. This file is that gate.

## What is compiled here

* **§1** the M-class phase form `phaseM a b m = a·m + b`, tied by `rfl`
  to the measured `OrderSigProbeM.phaseClockK`, with the empty-arena
  charge compiled constant and the arena-weight domination that carries
  it into the Σ interface.
* **§2** `g2m_exists` — the re-validated witness: for every level count,
  mass coefficient, round count and M-class constant family there are
  cost functions satisfying the **M-class** phase slots, the landed
  Σ-interface shapes of `RamDriverRoot.driverRoot_decides_sentence`
  verbatim (`hKmono`, `hKs`, the Σ-shaped `hKl`), and closing to
  `(ℓ·A + Cb)·(D+1)^ℓ·(w+1)`. The witness is `CostRecurrence`'s
  canonical solution; nothing is bespoke.
* **§3** the C0 close: the closed form inside `n^{1+ε}` at the C0 target
  shape, `#guard`ed at ε = 1 and ε = 1/2 on the star instance family,
  with **one gate at the measured 68/12**.
* **§4** the space side: the driver-shaped skeleton at M-class per-level
  arenas satisfies the E41 law — `mclass_driver_fits` is
  `nested_fits_iff`'s `←` consumed at a weight-linear setup and arena,
  and `mclass_space_needs_bounded_depth` is `no_word_size_for_nested`
  consumed at growing depth. Neither peak is re-derived.
* **§5** the negative control that bites: the SAME arithmetic with the
  order slot left at the landed size-blind `orderPhaseCost n ns W`
  reproduces `C0Probe.level_interface_floor`'s mechanism through the new
  Σ shape (`mixed_order_slot_floor`) and is then **unsatisfiable**
  together with the M-class closed form at the C0 numerals
  (`mclass_order_slot_load_bearing`). So the M-class charging is
  load-bearing, not decorative.
* **§6** the root term: `decodeDLCost = decodeCost + dedupCost + 4` (the
  decode, the dedup `31n + 50ns + 29`, and `lwCom`'s `4`) is
  weight-linear at coefficient `87`, and the restated root's cost text
  `Kdec + (Kl 0 (n + dedupNs x) + Ksent)` closes inside the same budget
  — read at the input weight `n + ns`, since `dedupNs x ≤ ns`.

## What this file does NOT claim

Nothing here edits, re-states or attributes any landed declaration. No
member list is threaded into any driver state; the M-class constants are
free parameters everywhere except at the gates, where they are the
measured `68`/`12`. That the *landed* walks do not meet the M-class
slots is the compiled gap ledger of `G2CostProbe` §7 and is unchanged by
this file — this file's question is the other one: **is the arithmetic
the re-derivation road proposes satisfiable at all, at the shapes P4.5
and P4.6 left behind?** The answer it compiles is yes.

/-! ### §1 The M-class phase form

P4.6 measured the shape, not a bound: the synthesized member-driven
phase's clock is `68·m + 12` at member count `m`, at two carrier widths,
with the carrier absent. `phaseM` is that shape with the constants free;
`phaseMR` charges `R + 1` of them (the base phase plus its `R`
augment/relink rounds, each a member-driven sweep family). -/

/-- **The M-class phase cost**: linear in the arena's MEMBER count, with
a constant empty-arena charge. The carrier size does not occur. -/
def phaseM (a b m : ℕ) : ℕ := a * m + b

/-- The same, over `R + 1` rounds. -/
def phaseMR (a b R m : ℕ) : ℕ := (1 + R) * phaseM a b m

/-- The weight-read budget an M-class phase fits into: at the arena
weight `w` (alive vertices plus their degree sum), the member count is
at most `w`, so `a·m + b` sits inside `(a + b)·(w + 1)`. -/
def phaseBudgetM (a b R w : ℕ) : ℕ := (1 + R) * (a + b) * (w + 1)

/-- **The measured law IS the M-class shape** — the tie to
`OrderSigProbeM.phaseClockK`, which was pinned on the tower's executable
semantics at `m ∈ {0, 2, 3}` and two carrier widths. -/
theorem phaseClockK_eq_phaseM (m : ℕ) :
    Lax3Proofs.Refine.OrderSigProbeM.phaseClockK m = phaseM 68 12 m := rfl

/-- **The empty-arena charge is a constant** — the P4.6 fact, in the
form the level recursion consumes: a nested level that runs no member
pays `(1 + R)·b`, with no `n` and no `W`. This is the exact place
`C0Probe.level_interface_floor` extracted its `Ω(n + W)`. -/

weight-read budget at coefficient `(1 + R)·(a + b)`. -/

/-! ### §2 The re-validated existence witness

The per-level constant of the recurrence, with the two live phase slots at
M-class coefficients instead of the landed size-blind forms. The turn
slot keeps `G2CostProbe.turnCostSizeA` verbatim — the size-READING turn
cost — since nothing in P4.5/P4.6 moved it. -/

/-- The per-level constant of the M-class recurrence: the order phase
over its `R + 1` rounds, the cover phase, and the turn's own leaves at
the mass coefficient. The former dead-sweep coefficient is absent because
that phase is absent from the program. -/
def g2M (ao bo ac bc R ct ksc D : ℕ) : ℕ :=
  (1 + R) * (ao + bo) + ((ac + bc) + ((ct + ksc + 3) * (D + 1) + 14))

/-- **The existence probe, re-validated at M-class phase costs.**

For every level count, mass coefficient, base coefficient, round count
and M-class constant family there are cost functions satisfying,
verbatim:

* the two live **M-class** phase slots — each stated at an arbitrary member
  count `m ≤ w`, so the budget must pay the phase at every arena the
  weight admits, and is `O(1)` in the carrier on the empty arena;
* the landed Σ-interface shapes of
  `RamDriverRoot.driverRoot_decides_sentence` byte for byte — the base
  clause, `hKmono`, `hKs` at the size-reading `turnCostSizeA`, and the
  Σ-shaped `hKl` at `Kmass := D`;

with the root budget geometric in `D + 1` and linear in the arena
weight. The witness is `CostRecurrence`'s canonical solution.

This is the positive half of the standing rule: the proposed side
conditions are not merely floor-free, they are **satisfied**, and the
satisfying family is exhibited. -/

The witness's root budget is `C · (D + 1)^ℓ · (w + 1)` and

parameter `D = ⌈c·w^{ε/ℓ}⌉₊`. The instance family is `C0Probe`'s own —
sparse members, `|x| = 3·n + 3`, all constants chosen before `n`:
`R = 0`, `D = 8`, `ℓ = 3`, `ct = 200` (`G2CostProbe.blockLeaves_le_weight`),
`ksc = Cb = ksent = 10⁴` (the scatter leaf is NOT yet M-class — E4b's

/-! ### §4 The space side (P4.5 / E41)

The re-derived driver is the **descending** skeleton: within a turn it
descends `levels` deep holding one arena live per level and then unwinds
LIFO. `SpaceBudget.peak_nestedSkel` and `SpaceBudget.nested_peak_attained`
pin its peak at `setup + levels·aw` exactly, and `nested_fits_iff` turns
that into the word-length law. Both directions are consumed here; no
peak is re-derived.

The M-class time law does NOT by itself discharge the space law — that
is `mclass_space_needs_bounded_depth` below, and it is why the
re-derivation road has to keep `levels·aw` linear as a separate
obligation. -/

/-- **The peak arithmetic**: a setup and a per-level arena that are both
weight-linear give a peak weight-linear at coefficient
`kset + levels·kaw` — the hypothesis side of E41's iff, at the shape the
re-derived driver has (`levels` fixed by the sentence and ε, `aw` the
level's own arena). -/

/-! ### §5 The negative control: the size-blind order slot still floors

`C0Probe.level_interface_floor` is a statement about the LANDED side
conditions. Its mechanism is re-read here through the **new** arithmetic
— the M-class Σ interface of §2, with `turnCostSizeA` in the turn slot
and every other slot free — and with exactly one slot left at the landed
size-blind `RamDriverCompose.orderPhaseCost n ns W`. The floor comes
straight back: a nested level pays the whole carrier-charged order phase
on the EMPTY arena, and the root level runs `n` turns of it.

Then the bite: at the C0 numerals that same interface is
**unsatisfiable** together with §2's closed form. So the M-class
charging is what buys the budget, not the Σ re-thread. -/

/-- **The floor, re-derived through the M-class Σ shape.** Nothing about
the other phase slots is assumed: only the turn slot (at
`G2CostProbe.turnCostSizeA`, the size-reading form §2 uses), the Σ-shaped

/-- **The control bites: the M-class order slot is load-bearing.** At the
C0 star numerals (`ℓ = 3`, `D = 8`, `Cb = 10⁴`, `ct = 200`, `ksc = 10⁴`,
`n = 10⁹`, `ns = 2·(n − 1)`, phases at the measured `68`/`12`), no cost
family satisfies the M-class arithmetic's turn and level shapes with the
order slot left size-blind AND stays inside §2's closed form. The
witness of `mclass_order_slot_satisfiable` satisfies the other three
clauses at the same numerals with the order slot M-class — so the
difference between the two is exactly the member-driven charging.

/-! ### §6 The root term: decode, dedup, and `lwCom`'s `4`

The restated root (`Refine/DriverRootD.lean`, landed 2026-08-06) reads
its cost as `Kdec + (Kl 0 (n + dedupNs x) + Ksent)`, with `hKdec`
covering `decodeCost n ns + dedupCost n ns + 4` — the decode, the
dedup, and the live-width scalar's `lwCom`. That whole `W`-term is
weight-linear at coefficient `87`, so it disappears into the geometric
factor. -/

theorem dedupCost_eq (n ns : ℕ) :
    Lax3Proofs.RamDriverDedup.dedupCost n ns = 31 * n + 50 * ns + 29 := rfl

/-- `RamDriverIO.decodeCost n ns = 45·n + 12·ns + 54`, cited. The root's
identity member list (rebase E-mem) is the `11·n + 8` of it. -/

/-- **The root `W`-term is weight-linear at `87`**: the composed
decode + dedup + `lwCom` charge that `hKdec` must cover
(`Refine.DriverRootD.decodeDLCost`) fits `87·(n + ns + 1)` — this is what
makes the `87` of `rootD_close` below a real coefficient and not a
choice. Rebase E-mem: the root member list moved the coefficient from
`79` to `87`, weight-linearly — the root arena IS the carrier. -/

/-- **The root closes inside the budget.** The restated root's cost text
`Kdec + (Kl 0 (n + nsd) + Ksent)` — with the level budget read at the
COMPACTED count `nsd = dedupNs x ≤ ns` and the decode charge at the
input's own `ns` — sits inside `(87 + ksent + C)·(D+1)^ℓ·(n + ns + 1)`.
The compaction is consumed through `hKmono`, which the `g2m_exists`
witness supplies; `decodeDLCost_le_weight` is what an admissible `Kdec`
(one satisfying the root's own `hKdec` slot tightly) reads. -/
