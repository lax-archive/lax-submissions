**The derivability sweep of the root theorem's hypothesis slots** — ND-MC
rebase, the B7 re-run's opening leaf (plan rev 3 delta 3).

Both of B7's gate failures were hypothesis slots that had been ruled fine
in prose and never checked: D4's "root input data" (`hcsr`, finding 1)
and §2.4's cost verdict (finding 2). Rev 3 therefore opens the re-run
with this: every slot of
`RamDriverRoot.driverRoot_decides_sentence` compiled against what a C0
discharge actually holds, before anything is restated or assembled.

**What a discharge holds.** C0
(`Lax3.ModelChecking.exists_almostLinearTime_program_modelChecking`)
fixes a nowhere dense class `C`, a sentence `φ` and an `ε > 0`, then asks
for a program `p`, a constant `c` and a bound `T` with
`(T x : ℝ) ≤ c * (|x| + 1) ^ (1 + ε)`, such that at **every** `n`, `G`
with `C n G` and **every** word length `w`, `p` computes the answer on
`{x | EncodesGraph x n G ∧ ∀ v ∈ x, c * (|x| + v + 1) ≤ 2 ^ w}` within
`T`. So the data available at a slot is: `EncodesGraph x n G`, the domain
word clause, `C n G` and nowhere-density of `C`, and free choices of
every parameter the root leaves open — all of the latter chosen **before**
`n`, `G`, `w` and `x`, because `p` and `c` are.

## The table

Thirty slots, in the root's own order. `producer` = closed here or by a
named landed theorem; `free` = discharged by choosing the parameter;
`BLOCKED` = compiled obstruction, no producer exists.

| 13 | `hWB` | free at `R = 0` (`W := ns`) | `slot13_hWB` |
| 14 | `hpow` | free — parameter constant | `slot14_hpow` |
| 15 | `hQ` | producer | `slot15_hQ` |

| 28 | `hKdec` | free — defines `Kdec` | note in §A |
| 29 | `hatoms` | free — finite atom list, `B` large | note in §A |
| 30 | `hKsent` | free — defines `Ksent` | note in §A |

Twenty-three of the remaining slots are free or producered. **Six block**, in three
independent groups, and only the first was known when this leaf opened:

* **#6 `hcsr`** — B7 finding 1, repaired by G1 but *not yet at the root*:
  the repair lives in `RamDriverDedup.DecodeImplementsD`, and the root
  still reads its `CsrSimple` at the raw word. Dies at the `driverRootD`
  restatement (§B).
* **#26 `hdeg`, and hence #12 `hB`** — new here (§C). The slot is
  quantified over **every** permutation, and at a star with the centre
  ordered last the weakly-`2·cap`-reachable set is the whole vertex set.
  So no `Kmass` constant in `n` satisfies it on any class containing the
  stars, and `Refine.ArenaWidth`'s flip — which needs the degree
  parameter fixed before `n`, its own control 2
  (`no_wordConst_at_linear_degree`) — is not available through it. The
  intended producer, `RamDriverRoot.exists_wreachDeg_of_orderP`, delivers
  the bound only at orderings carrying `RamDriverCompose.OrderP R`, which
  is what the `levelAtR` / general-`R` restatement is for. Until that
  lands, finding 3's repair does not reach the root's own `hdeg`.
* **#20/#22/#23/#27, the cost group** — B7 finding 2, alive and sharper
  (§D). The root's own cost is at least `16 · n³`, from **two** slots
  (`hKs`, `hKl`) with no width path, no `chainWidth`, no `hWc` and no
  `W` anywhere in the derivation; at least `128 · n³` with `hKo` and
  `hKc` added. This is over C0's budget at every `ε < 2`.

**So C0 is not reachable through the root as it stands**, and the
obstruction is the cost residue (E-mem → member-driven interiors →
E-order re-run → E3b → E4c → R1.8), not anything the B7 re-run can
repair. §D names the responsible hypothesis shape for each blocked cost
slot, so the sweep is usable as that residue's work-list.

**A correction, recorded because it is in a landed commit message and a
landed plan section.** `Refine.BridgeSeamProbe.width_lt_two_pow` does
**not** close B7 finding 2. It says the `chainWidth n d D₁ R ≤ W` pin is
unaddressable as a matter of *word length*: `hWB` puts `W` under `B`,
`FitsWords` puts `B` under `2 ^ w`, and C0's smallest admissible `w` is
linear in `|x|`. That is a space statement about `W`. Finding 2 is a
*cost* statement about `Kl`, and §D derives it with `W` absent from both
the hypotheses used and the conclusion (`root_cost_floor_cubic`). The two
are compiled side by side in §E so the distinction is checkable rather
than asserted.

/-! ## §A. The free and producered slots

Twenty-four of the thirty. The ones below are compiled; the remainder are
free by the same one-line argument and are recorded in the table rather
than restated here, because each is literally "instantiate the parameter
at the expression the slot bounds":

* **#16 `hbnd` / #29 `hatoms`** — `tablesAt q_top cap mb φ j` and
  `bcAtomsOf` produce **finite lists** determined by `q_top`, `cap`, `mb`
  and `φ` alone; `Kb`/`Kb₀` are the maxima of `RamDriverIO.atomCost n ns`
  over them, and the two `< B` clauses are finitely many constants of the
  parameters, so #12's bound covers them.
* **#17 `hcostI`, #18 `hKsc`, #21 `hKbase`, #28 `hKdec`,
  #30 `hKsent`** — each bounds a closed expression by a free parameter;
  take the parameter to be that expression.
* **#19 `hKmono`** — `CostRecurrence`'s closed form is monotone in the
  size argument by construction.

None of these six-plus-six is where a gate has ever failed, and none of
them constrains another slot. The compiled ones below are the slots whose
producer is either C0's own data or a named landed theorem. -/

(`Refine.ArenaWidth.word_size_for_encoded`, which also delivers
`FitsWords`). Stated here as the conjunction a discharge has to produce,
so that §C's obstruction attaches to the right place.

At `R = 0` the width may be taken to be the slot count (`W := ns`), which
is what makes #13 a consequence of #12's own clause rather than a new
demand; the general-`R` restatement re-imports a width pin, and §E is
where that is measured. -/

/-! ## §B. Slot #6 `hcsr` — blocked at the landed root, producered at the
dedup'd data

B7 finding 1, restated so the sweep is self-contained: `EncodesGraph`
deliberately permits a row to name a neighbour twice, and the root reads
`RamElim.CsrSimple` at the raw word. G1 repaired this, but **in the
composed decode phase, not at the root**: `RamDriverDedup.decodeImplementsD`
delivers `CsrSimple` at `dedupNs x`, `dedupOffset x`, `dedupTarget x`,
and the root still asks for it at `2 * edgeCount x`, `offset x`,
`target x`. The slot therefore has no producer *today* and a producer the
moment the root is restated on the composed decode. -/

is a root restatement and not a lemma. -/

      (RamDriverDedup.dedupTarget x) :=
  RamDriverDedup.csrSimple_dedup hx

end Csr

/-! ## §C. Slot #26 `hdeg` — no constant `Kmass`, and slot #12 falls with
it

This is the sweep's new finding, and it is the one that matters for
finding 3's repair.

The root's slot is

```lean
hdeg : ∀ (M : ℕ → ℕ) (π : Equiv.Perm (Fin n)) (v : Fin n),
  (Lax12.ColoringNumbers.wreach (RamBfs.masked G M) π (2 * cap) v).ncard ≤ Kmass
```

— quantified over **every** permutation. Weak reachability is a property
of the *ordering*, not of the graph: a graph of maximum degree `d` has an
ordering under which every weakly-`r`-reachable set is small, and (if it
has a vertex of degree `d`) an ordering under which one of them has `d+1`
elements. The slot asks for the bound under all of them.

At the star on `Fin n` with the centre ordered last, the centre weakly
reaches the whole vertex set at radius `1`, so the slot forces
`n ≤ Kmass`. Stars are members of essentially every nowhere dense class
one would state C0 for, so no `Kmass` chosen before `n` — which is what
C0's `∃ c` before `∀ n` requires — satisfies the slot.

The consequence for #12 is immediate and is exactly `ArenaWidth`'s own
control 2: `WordBoundK B n Kmass ns cap mb` with `Kmass ≥ n` *is* the
retired carrier bound `WordBound B n ns cap mb`, and
`ArenaWidth.no_wordConst_at_linear_degree` refutes the flip there. So the
E-mem/W1–W3 repair of finding 3 is sound at the *slot*, and not yet
usable at the *root*, because the root's `hdeg` is the wrong shape to
supply the constant it needs.

The producer that has the right shape exists:
`RamDriverRoot.exists_wreachDeg_of_orderP` bounds the degree at orderings
carrying `RamDriverCompose.OrderP R G M π ord`, on a nowhere dense class,
by `⌈c · n ^ δ⌉₊`. It is unavailable at `R = 0`, where `levelAt` supplies
`OrderP` as `True`. Threading it is the `levelAtR` / general-`R`
restatement — B7's own next piece. -/

/-! ## §D. Slots #20/#22/#23/#27 — the cost group, and the cubic floor

B7 finding 2, alive, and sharper than it was recorded.

`C0Probe.level_interface_floor` derived `n * (60 * W + 1600 * n) ≤ Kl 0 n`
from `hKs`, `hKo` and `hKl`, and `level_interface_floor_cubic` reached
`60 * n³` only through `hWc : chainWidth n d D₁ R ≤ W`, a hypothesis of
the *ordering phase* and not of the root. That extra hypothesis is not
needed. The `n²` is inside the **turn cost itself**:

RamDriverDescend.descendCost n ns cap j = 16 * (n * n) + 75 * n + 51 + …
```

and `RamDriverRoot.turnCost` opens with it. So `hKs` alone charges
`16 * n²` per turn, `hKl` runs `n` turns at the root, and the product is
cubic with `W` occurring nowhere.

**Which hypothesis shape is responsible** — the residue's work-list:

* **#20 `hKs`** — `turnCostSize … ≤ Ks j t` at a turn cost whose
  descent charges `16 * n²` for the level's *own* carrier, at every turn,
  independent of the block the turn processes. The readback now reads the
  size slot, but this descent summand still does not. Repair: the descent's
  block-driven interior (E4c, `descendCom` swap / `qd` layout /
  alive-mask hoist).
* **#22 `hKo`** — `orderPhaseCost n ns W ≤ Ko j m` is **size-blind** in
  `m`: it charges `1600 * n + 1350 * ns + 60 * W + 650` on the *empty*
  arena. Repair: E-mem member lists, then the member-driven order
  interior; E-order's no-escape theorem is the statement that no closed
  form survives an empty-arena carrier charge.
* **#23 `hKc`** — `coverPhaseCost n ns ≤ Kc j m`, also size-blind, and
  quadratic on its own face: `RamCover.coverCost n ns` is
  `100 * n * n + 50 * n * ns + …` and the phase adds `12 * (n * n)`.
  Repair: E3b (cover composition, `compactCom`-before-`coverSave`).
* **#27 `hKl`** — the level bill sums `Ks j (bs c)` over `t ≤ m` turns
  and adds `Ko j m + Kc j m` once. It is the multiplier: it is
  what turns any per-turn carrier charge into a cubic. It is also the
  slot that is *correct* — the sum over blocks is the shape the mass
  recursion needs — so the repair is in its summands, not in it.

The former `hKd` slot (#24) has since been retired with the dead sweep;
none of the floor argument depended on it. Nor does it use `hKbase` (#21). -/

/-! ### The plug check

The floor above is stated at hypothesis shapes; what says those shapes
are the root's is this application. The theorem takes
`RamDriverRoot.driverRoot_decides_sentence`'s hypothesis list verbatim
(plus `2 ≤ ℓ`, which is data about the class and not a slot) and returns
the root's own conclusion **together with** the floor on the root's own
cost expression. It elaborates only if every slot it forwards is the one
the root has. -/

open Classical in
/-- **The root, with its own cost floored.** The `Spec` is
`driverRoot_decides_sentence`'s, unweakened, and the second component
says its cost `Kdec + (Kl 0 (n + ns) + Ksent)` is at least `128 · n³`.

`hKmono` is what carries the floor from `Kl 0 n` to `Kl 0 (n + ns)`, so
the weight re-read of rebase E6 does not evade it. -/

/-! ### The floor against C0's budget

C0 asks for `(T x : ℝ) ≤ c * (|x| + 1) ^ (1 + ε)` at every `ε > 0`, with
`c` chosen before the instance. On a word encoding a graph,
`|x| = 3 + n + ns`, so at the edgeless member `|x| = n + 3` and the
budget at `ε = 1/2` is `c * (n + 4) ^ (3/2)`. Squaring both sides, the
check is `c² * (n + 4)³ < (128 · n³)²`, and one large instance settles it
because `c` is fixed first. -/

-- at `c = 10 ^ 6` and `n = 10 ^ 8`, the cubic floor is over the `ε = 1/2`
-- budget by twelve orders of magnitude
#guard (10 ^ 6) ^ 2 * (10 ^ 8 + 4) ^ 3 < (128 * (10 ^ 8) ^ 3) ^ 2

-- the negative control: the same comparison at `ε = 3` — a budget C0 does
-- *not* ask for at every `ε` — is satisfied, so the `#guard` above is
-- about the exponent and not about the constants
#guard 128 * (10 ^ 8) ^ 3 < 10 ^ 6 * (10 ^ 8 + 4) ^ 4

/-! ## §E. `width_lt_two_pow` does not close finding 2

Recorded because the opposite is written in a landed commit message and a
landed plan section, and a compiled distinction outlives both.

The two statements below are the whole of it. The first is a *space*
statement: it bounds `W`, the ordering phase's width parameter, by the
machine's addressable range, and it is what makes the general-`R`
`chainWidth n d D₁ R ≤ W` pin unaddressable rather than merely expensive.
The second is a *cost* statement: it bounds `Kl`, the level budget, from
below. Its derivation (`level_cost_floor_cubic`) mentions neither `W` nor
`2 ^ w` nor any layout, and its hypotheses are two slots that carry no
width.

So the `WordBoundK` repair and `width_lt_two_pow` between them close
finding 3 and re-read finding 2's *width* half; the cost floor is
untouched by both, and survives at `W = ns`, at `W = 0`, and with the
width path deleted entirely. -/
