**The bridge seam, crossed** — ND-MC rebase, wave E-mem, leaf W3's
acceptance.

`Refine.BridgeSeamProbe` §5 (`no_word_size_for_sparse`) showed that the
landed root theorem could not cross the `Spec → ComputesInTime` bridge:
its word-bound slot was `RamDriver.WordBound`, whose arena clause pins
`n * n + ns + 2 * cap + 2 < B`, and that is jointly unsatisfiable with
`Compile.Layout.FitsWords B w` at word lengths C0's own domain admits.
`Refine.ArenaWidth` compiled the repair route — `RamDriver.WordBoundK`,
the same clause with the arena read at a degree parameter, and
`word_size_for_encoded`, which says a value bound exists at *every* word
of C0's domain. W1 and W2 re-walked the cover pass and threaded the new
slot through every phase; W3 restated the root at it.

This file is the acceptance: the repair, stated **at the root theorem's
own hypothesis**, not at a lookalike.

1. **§1** — `RootBound`, the root theorem's word-bound slot, named, with
   the plug check `driverRoot_decides_sentence_bound`: the root
   restated with the name in that position and proved by the root
   itself. It type-checks only if `RamDriverRoot`'s `hB` really is
   `WordBoundK` at the degree parameter its own `hdeg` slot bounds — a
   different degree, or the retired `WordBound`, and the term fails.
2. **§2** — the slot is satisfiable at every word of C0's domain and
   every word length that domain admits (`word_size_for_root`), in C0's
   own quantifier order, constant first (`exists_wordConst_root`).
3. **§3, the sharp form** — at the very instance where
   `no_word_size_for_sparse` kills the old bound *for every value
   bound*, the restated root's slot has one
   (`root_flip_at_the_refuting_instance`), and the probe's own theorem,
   restated at the root's slot, is **false** (`no_word_size_at_root`).
   The bridge is no longer refuted on space grounds.
4. **§4 — the controls, and they bite.** The same statement is false at
   the retired carrier bound, false when the degree parameter is allowed
   to grow with the instance, and false when the layout's array count
   does — so §2 rests on `Kmass` being a constant of the class (which is
   what `RamDriverRoot`'s `hdeg` says) and on the driver's array count
   being constant in `n`.

**Scope, stated exactly.** What is crossed here is finding 3, and only
finding 3. The seam's finding 4 — `RamDriver.OrderMem`'s live-width
scalar reading `ns ≤ 0` at `initEnv`
(`BridgeSeamProbe.rootPre_initEnv_iff_ns_zero`) — is untouched and still
open; its repair is one assignment inside the decode
(`BridgeSeamProbe.lwCom_spec`, cost `4`) and belongs to the B7 re-run,
which restates the root anyway. And this is a *space* result, not a cost
result: the cover pass still charges `RamCover.coverCost`'s
`100 * n * n + …`, which is the E-order/B7 residue.

/-! ## 1. The root theorem's word-bound slot, named and plugged -/

/-- **The word bound `RamDriverRoot.driverRoot_decides_sentence` takes**
(rebase E-mem/W3): the value bound of a level with the cluster arena's
pointer ceiling read at the cover-degree parameter `Kmass` rather than
at the carrier.

`Kmass` is not a new parameter. It is the root theorem's own `hdeg`
slot — the constant bounding the weak `2·cap`-reachability degree of the
ordering the cover is taken along, produced on a nowhere dense class by
`RamDriverRoot.exists_wreachDeg_of_orderP` — and that identity is what
`driverRoot_decides_sentence_bound` below checks. -/

/-! ## 2. The slot is satisfiable at every word of C0's domain

`Refine.ArenaWidth.word_size_for_encoded` at the root's own degree
parameter. C0 fixes its constant before the instance:

```
∃ p c T, … ∧ ∀ n G w, C n G → ComputesInTime w p
  {x | EncodesGraph x n G ∧ ∀ v ∈ x, c * (x.length + v + 1) ≤ 2 ^ w} … T
```

so the statement to prove is: **one** `c` — read off the compile layout
and the constant profile `(Kmass, cap, mb)`, all of them constants of
the class and the sentence — then every `n`, every admissible `w` and
every member `x` of the domain, then a value bound satisfying the
layout's fits-words condition *and* the root's slot. -/

/-! ## 3. The sharp form: the seam probe no longer refutes the root -/

section Sharp

/-- **The flip, at the refuting instance itself.** One `n`, one word,
one word length: the very `w` at which
`BridgeSeamProbe.no_word_size_for_sparse` refutes the retired
`RamDriver.WordBound` for *every* value bound admits a value bound for
the root's restated slot. The two halves are read off the same C0 domain
membership, so this is not two scopes compared — it is the same seam,
before and after the arena width left the word bound. -/
theorem root_flip_at_the_refuting_instance (L : Layout) (hA : 1 ≤ L.arrays.length)
    (Kmass cap mb n : ℕ)
    (hcross : 4 * ArenaWidth.wordConst L Kmass cap mb * (n + 2) ≤ n * n) :
    ∃ w : ℕ,
      (∀ B ns' cap' mb' : ℕ, L.FitsWords B w → ¬ WordBound B n ns' cap' mb') ∧
      (∃ B, L.FitsWords B w ∧ RootBound B n Kmass 0 cap mb) :=
  ArenaWidth.flip_at_the_refuting_instance L hA Kmass cap mb n hcross

/-- **The seam probe's own theorem, restated at the root's slot, is
false.** `BridgeSeamProbe.no_word_size_for_sparse` says: for every
constant and every instance past its crossover there is an admissible
word length at which no value bound satisfies both `FitsWords` and the
driver's word bound. With the driver's word bound replaced by the one
the root now carries, that statement fails — at the layout's own
constant, at the first instance past its crossover.

This is the acceptance criterion of W3: the argument that killed the
bridge does not merely fail to apply, it is refutable.

Two of the probe's universal quantifiers move outside, and they have to:
the layout and the constant profile `(Kmass, cap, mb)` are constants of
the class and the sentence, chosen before the instance. §4's controls
are what says that is not a loophole — the statement is false again the
moment the degree parameter or the array count is allowed to grow with
`n`. -/
theorem no_word_size_at_root (L : Layout) (hA : 1 ≤ L.arrays.length) (Kmass cap mb : ℕ) :
    ¬ ∀ (c n : ℕ), 0 < c → 4 * c * (n + 2) ≤ n * n →
      ∃ w : ℕ, EncodesGraph (emptyWord n) n (⊥ : SimpleGraph (Fin n)) ∧
        (∀ v ∈ emptyWord n, c * ((emptyWord n).length + v + 1) ≤ 2 ^ w) ∧
        ∀ (B ns : ℕ), L.FitsWords B w → ¬ RootBound B n Kmass ns cap mb := by

  obtain ⟨n, hn⟩ : ∃ n, n = 8 * c + 16 := ⟨_, rfl⟩

      (by rw [show edgeCount (emptyWord n) = 0 from rfl])
      (by rw [← hc]; exact hdom)
  exact hkill B 0 hfit hwb

/-- **The control that makes the last theorem bite**: the *same
statement shape*, with the root's slot replaced by the bound the root
carried before W3, is **true** — it is
`BridgeSeamProbe.no_word_size_for_sparse`, with the layout and the
profile pulled out exactly as in `no_word_size_at_root`.

So the difference between the two is the slot and nothing else: not the
quantifier order, not the witness family, not the layout's position.
`no_word_size_at_root` refutes at `RootBound` precisely what this proves
at `RamDriver.WordBound`. -/

    ∀ (c n : ℕ), 0 < c → 4 * c * (n + 2) ≤ n * n →

        ∀ (B ns : ℕ), L.FitsWords B w → ¬ WordBound B n ns cap mb := by
  intro c n hc hcross
  obtain ⟨w, henc, hdom, hkill⟩ := no_word_size_for_sparse c n hc hcross
  exact ⟨w, henc, hdom, fun B ns hfit => hkill L B ns cap mb hfit⟩

end Sharp

/-! ## 4. The controls, and they bite

Three refutations of §2's statement, each with one ingredient of the
root's slot changed back. They are `Refine.ArenaWidth`'s controls read
at `RootBound`, so that no control is refuting something this file also
needs. -/

section Controls

/-- **Control 1 — the arena width is what does the work.** At the
retired carrier bound the same statement is false: this is the seam
probe's finding 3 in §2's shape. -/
theorem no_wordConst_at_carrier (L : Layout) (cap mb : ℕ) :
    ¬ ∃ c : ℕ, 0 < c ∧ ∀ (n ns w : ℕ) (G : SimpleGraph (Fin n)) (x : List ℕ),
      EncodesGraph x n G → ns = 2 * edgeCount x →

      ∃ B, L.FitsWords B w ∧ WordBound B n ns cap mb :=
  ArenaWidth.no_wordConst_at_square L cap mb

/-- **Control 2 — `Kmass` must be a constant of the class, not of the
instance.** The root's `hdeg` slot bounds the cover degree by a `Kmass`
chosen before the instance (`RamDriverRoot.exists_wreachDeg_of_orderP`
produces it from nowhere denseness). If it were allowed to grow like
`n`, the root's slot would be the carrier bound again and control 1
would apply. -/
theorem no_wordConst_at_linear_degree (L : Layout) (cap mb : ℕ) :
    ¬ ∃ c : ℕ, 0 < c ∧ ∀ (n ns w : ℕ) (G : SimpleGraph (Fin n)) (x : List ℕ),

      ∃ B, L.FitsWords B w ∧ RootBound B n n ns cap mb :=
  ArenaWidth.no_wordConst_at_linear_degree L cap mb

/-- **Control 3 — the layout's array count must be constant in the
instance.** With an array count growing like `n`, `span B = n * B` is
quadratic again and no constant works even at the almost-linear arena
width. The driver's own count is constant in `n`: its per-depth, colour
and table arrays are indexed by `ℓ`, `sigL cap mb j` and
`tablesAt q_top cap mb φ j`, all functions of the sentence and the
class. -/
theorem no_wordConst_growing_layout (Kmass cap mb : ℕ) :
    ¬ ∃ c : ℕ, 0 < c ∧ ∀ (n ns w : ℕ) (G : SimpleGraph (Fin n)) (x : List ℕ),

      ∃ B, (ArenaWidth.bigLayout n).FitsWords B w ∧ RootBound B n Kmass ns cap mb :=
  ArenaWidth.no_wordConst_growing_layout Kmass cap mb

/-- **Control 4 — the crossing is not vacuous.** `FitsWords` and the
root's slot are jointly satisfiable at numerals: one array, no scalars,
no temps; cover degree `8`, radius cap `2`, padded width `10`; the
edgeless word on `200` vertices, `|x| = 203`, at the value bound
`ArenaWidth.boundAt 203 8 2 10 = 1844` and word length `w = 11`. -/
