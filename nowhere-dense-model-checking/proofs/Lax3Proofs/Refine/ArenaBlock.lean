**Arenas against blocks** — the two counting facts the Σ-shaped cost
interface needs (`plans/nowhere-dense-model-checking/integration-design.md`
§5, brief B2).

The Σ interface charges a level the *sum* of its turns, each read at its
own cover block's size. Two inequalities make that legal, and neither of
them is about the machine:

1. **A cluster is no bigger than its block** (`ncard_clusterAt_le_blockSize`).
   `RamCover.CoverOut.block` makes the block's slots *onto* the cluster,
   so the cluster is the image of an interval of `blockSize` positions.
   `Refine.MassMath.blockSize_eq_ncard` is the same statement with
   equality, and it needs `MassMath.BlockInj` — the clause `CoverOut`
   does not carry. The `≤` direction needs **no** injectivity: an image
   is never larger than its source. This is the direction the descent's
   §5.3 clause uses (`RamDriverDescend.descendStep`), so that clause
   costs nothing beyond what the cover pass already proves.

2. **The turns are at most the arena** (`cnum_le_arenaSize`). If the
   compacted list names *live* centres, then `k ↦ ord (cps k)` is an
   injection of the turns into the alive set, so `cnum ≤ arenaSize` —
   which is the `t ≤ m` antecedent
   `CostRecurrence.exists_driverCostsSigma` asks for, and which no
   counting against the arena's *length* can give (that number is at
   least `n` at every depth).

`mass_of_alive_compaction` puts the two together with wave B4's
`Refine.MassAlive.aliveMass_le` and delivers, in one term, exactly the
pair `RamDriverCluster.levelImplements` takes as its `hmass`.

# The clause that was missing, and how it was supplied (B8)

Everything above is hypothetical on `∀ k < cnum, A₀ (ord (cps k)) ≠ 0`
— the compaction lists live centres. B3's `RamDriver.compactCom`
filtered on *non-empty block* instead, and `MassAlive.block_nonempty`
says every block of a cover output is non-empty, so B3's list was the
whole carrier (`MassAlive.cnum_eq_of_nonempty`) and the clause was not
available. Adding the aliveness test to `compactCom` is one nested
`ite`; what it cost was not the walk but the **induction**, and
`dead_vertex_has_no_alive_turn` below compiles the reason: a vertex lies
in its assigned centre's cluster, clusters are alive-homogeneous
(`MassAlive.inCluster_alive_iff`), so an alive-filtered list omits
exactly the *dead* vertices' positions — while
`RamDriverCluster.levelImplements`' partition step needs every carrier
vertex's table row (`RamDriver.TableInv` quantifies over all of them,
and a turn's readback reads the depth-`(j+1)` table at cluster vertices
the batch has killed).

Wave B8 supplies the row without the turn. On the arena a dead vertex
sees, nothing happens — it has no incident edge, so a *local* formula at
it is decided by the edgeless reading (`Refine.DeadRow.sat_bot_of_dead`)
— and `RamDriver.sweepCom`, the base case's own vertex walk run at the
level's depth, writes exactly that. So `Compacted` now carries `alive`
as a clause, `mass_of_alive_compaction` takes no side hypothesis at all,
and the level's partition splits: the alive vertices by their turn, the
dead ones by the sweep.

Everything here is a statement about counting, not about a program; all
of it was `#guard`-checked on degenerate covers before it was proved.

/-! ### The turns, counted against the arena

The level condition of `CostRecurrence.exists_driverCostsSigma` reads
two numbers off a level: the number of turns `t` — which it needs below
the arena size `m` — and the total sub-arena size over the turns. The
first is here; the second is wave B4's `MassAlive.sum_blockSize_cps_le_aliveMass`
composed with `MassAlive.aliveMass_le`. -/

/-- **A compaction of live centres takes at most `arenaSize` turns.**
The turns' centres are distinct vertices (`cps` is injective by strict
monotonicity, `ord` is injective by `OrdersBy`) and every one of them is
alive, so the turn count is bounded by the alive set — which is the
`t ≤ m` antecedent of the Σ level condition.

This is the only route to that antecedent. Counting against the arena's
*length* cannot give it: `MassAlive.mass_eq_aliveMass_add_dead` says the
length is at least the number of dead centres, so at a nested depth it
exceeds the arena size. -/

/-- **The level's whole cost supply, given the one missing clause.**
Exactly the pair `RamDriverCluster.levelImplements` takes as `hmass`: the
turn count under the arena size, and the turns' sub-arenas under
`d · (arenaSize + 1)`.

Its hypotheses are the cover pass's own postcondition
(`RamCover.CoverOut`, `OrdersBy`), the block injectivity of B6/B4
(`MassMath.BlockInj`), the cover-degree bound of B5
(`CoverDegree.exists_cover_degree`'s conclusion) and the compaction
itself — **and nothing else**: `Compacted.alive` is now a clause of the
compaction (wave B8), so the side hypothesis this theorem used to carry
has become part of what `RamDriver.compactCom` proves. -/

/-! ### The blocker, compiled -/

/-- **Why the aliveness filter is not a free program delta.** A vertex is
in the cluster of the centre it is assigned to, and clusters are
alive-homogeneous, so a *dead* vertex's assigned centre is dead — and an
alive-filtered compaction does not list it. `levelImplements`' partition
step asks the opposite: that every carrier vertex's assigned position is
listed. So the filter and the present induction cannot both stand; the
level needs a path for dead vertices first. -/

/-! ### Falsification

Both statements were checked on data first, on the two degenerate covers
`Refine.MassMath` uses — a block that repeats a vertex, and an empty
block — plus the star instance the cost probe is built on. The second
`#guard` is a **refutation**: without the compaction's injectivity the
sum of the listed blocks overshoots the arena, so
`cnum_le_arenaSize` cannot drop `Compacted.mono`. -/
