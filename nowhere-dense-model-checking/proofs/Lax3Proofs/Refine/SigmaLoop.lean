**The counted scan at per-turn costs** — the Σ-shaped loop rule of the
ND-MC integration wave.

`Lax13Proofs.Reasoning.Spec.forRangeZero` charges every turn of a
counted scan the same budget `Kb`, so a loop over the centres of a
cover pays `n · max-turn` even when the true total is `Σ_c |X_c|` —
the star instance (`Refine.CostShapeProbe`) shows the gap is
quadratic-vs-linear. `forRangeZeroSum` below is the same rule with the
body given **per counter value**: turn `k` owes `Kb k`, and the loop
exports `Σ_{k<N} (Kb k + 4) + 6`. Instantiating `Kb` constantly
recovers `forRangeZero`'s bound exactly, so the rule strictly refines
the uniform one (`sum_const_bound` in `CostShapeProbe` is that
comparison, compiled).

This is *capital for the Σ-shape revision* of
`RamDriverCluster.levelImplements` (integration-design.md §5): the
centre loop's per-turn budget must read the turn's own cluster data —
`Kb k` there is the per-turn overhead plus the nested driver at the
sub-arena of block `k`. The rule lives here, in the consumer package,
because `word-ram/` is owned by a parallel wave; it is proved from
`Spec.while_potential` alone, exactly as `Spec.forRange` is.

The potential is `Φ σ = Σ_{k ∈ [x, N)} (Kb k + 4)`: one guard (`+4` is
`1 + size(x < m)`) and one body per remaining turn. The peel at the
step is `Finset.sum_eq_sum_Ico_succ_bot`; everything else is
`forRangeZero`'s own walk.

/-- **The counted scan from zero, with one budget per turn.**
`x := 0; while x < m do c`, where the turn at counter value `k` is
specified with its own cost `Kb k`. The loop costs the sum of the
turns, not `N` times the worst one: `Σ_{k<N} (Kb k + 4) + 6`.

The hypotheses are `Spec.forRangeZero`'s with the body quantified over
the counter value; a body that does not care recovers the uniform rule
by ignoring `k`. -/
