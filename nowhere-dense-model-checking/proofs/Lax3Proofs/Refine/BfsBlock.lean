# Block-driven breadth-first search: the touched-only engine

`RamBfs.bfsCom` searches correctly and charges the *carrier*: its cost is
`51 n + 44 ns + 30`, linear in the whole graph, and it is linear in the
whole graph for one reason only — it begins by filling the entire
distance array with the sentinel. A level of the cover pass runs a search
from every centre it claims, and there are `Θ(n)` of them; an `O(n)` fill
per centre is an `Ω(n²)` level, which is exactly the phase-cost floor the
B7 gate compiled. Nothing about the *search* is carrier-sized — a ball of
radius `r` around a centre touches `1 + deg v` cells per vertex it
reaches and not one more. Only the fill is.

So this file removes the fill, and pays for removing it with a contract.

### Clean in, clean out

`bfsBlockCom d` is `seedSrc; bfsDrain; unwind d` — the landed search with
its initial fill deleted at the front and an **unwind** bolted on at the
back. The precondition is that the distance array *already* holds the
sentinel everywhere,

    σ.arrs "dist" = arrOf n (fun _ => d + 1),

and the postcondition is that it holds the sentinel everywhere again, on
the nose, as the same list. In between, the search writes a distance
into `dist v` exactly for the vertices `v` it reaches, and the unwind
walks the queue — which *is* the list of vertices it reached, in arrival
order — and puts the sentinel back into each one. The unwind is
therefore charged to the ball and not to the carrier, and the level pays
the `O(n)` cleaning **once**, before its first centre, instead of once
per centre.

This is the P0.4 trail-acceptance mechanism with the trail already
present in the data: `Refine/BlockLeaves.lean`'s header records that a
known write set is better than a trail when the write set *is* known,
and here it is known — the write set of `dist` is the queue segment
`q[0 .. tail)` together with the source cell. The queue is the trail, so
the engine carries no trail array.

The source cell is the one that needs saying twice. `seedSrc` writes
`dist src := 0` **unconditionally** — a walk of length zero needs no
edges, so a dead source is at distance zero from itself — but it puts
the source on the queue only when the mask says it is alive. A dead
source is thus written and never enqueued, and the queue would not find
it. The unwind therefore ends with one unconditional store,
`dist src := d + 1`, which is a no-op when the source was alive and is
the whole restoration when it was not.

### What comes out

The search's answer cannot be left in `dist`, because `dist` is wiped.
It is handed back in two parallel arrays instead, both written only up to
`tail`:

* `q[0 .. tail)` — the vertices the search reached, without repetition,
  in breadth-first order. This is the **reached-set reading**: the
  segment is exactly the ball, `{v | M v ≠ 0 ∧ WD G M d s v}`.
* `qd[0 .. tail)` — their distances, `qd i` being the distance of `q i`.
  This is the **distance reading**, at the landed threshold form:
  `qd i ≤ k ↔ WD G M k s (q i)` for every `k ≤ d`, which is
  `RamBfs.Frontier.dist_le_iff` transported across the unwind.

The unwind copies each distance into `qd` on its way past, so the two
readings cost one pass over the ball between them.

`q` and `qd` are **output, not scratch**, and the contract treats them
that way: the precondition asks nothing of either beyond their length
(`∃ g, σ.arrs "q" = arrOf n g`), and the postcondition constrains only
the segment below `tail`. Nothing is claimed about the cells above it,
and nothing needs to be — that is precisely what makes a level of many
centres compose. Each centre writes `q` from index `0` upwards and reads
only below its own tail, so whatever the previous centre left higher up
is unreachable. The one array whose residue *would* compound is `dist`,
and `dist` is the one the engine restores exactly.

So "exit state = entry state" is a claim about `dist`, and it is the
literal one: the same list, cell for cell. `BfsBlockDiff.lean`'s sentinel
gate is its compiled reading.

### The cap convention

A vertex reached at depth exactly `d` is dequeued and its whole block is
scanned, relaxing nothing — the sentinel makes every test fail there.
This is the landed program's convention, inherited verbatim because the
program text is inherited verbatim, and the cost form agrees with it: the
ball's weight sums `1 + deg v` over vertices reached at depth **at most**
`d`, the depth-`d` vertices included with their full rows. An engine of
this family that dropped the depth-`d` rows would be cheaper and would
need a different program; this one does not, and the differential gate at
`d = 1` in `BfsBlockDiff.lean` pins the boundary against the landed
search's own answer.

### The charge

`bfsBlockK bw nb = 44 bw + 80 nb + 60`, where `bw` bounds the ball's slot
weight and `nb` its size. **No `n`, no `ns`.** The caller supplies any
finite `A` containing the ball and is charged for `A`; a block-driven
consumer passes its own block, and gets the arena-charged reading its
interface asks for.

Three commands, two of them the landed search's own. Only `unwind` is

the answer leaves in `q` and `qd`. -/

Two numbers, and neither of them is the carrier: the slot weight of the

/-! ### The ball, and the two bounds the potential is paid out of

The landed search's potential is `44 (ns - sc) + 40 (n - tail) + 40 (tail
- head)`: the slots not yet scanned, the vertices not yet enqueued, and
the queue's own length. The first two terms are the carrier, and they are
there for a reason — `sc ≤ ns` and `tail ≤ n` are what make the
truncated subtractions behave.

Both bounds have a ball-sized twin, and that is the whole of the cost
argument. Everything the queue ever holds lies in the ball, so `tail` is
bounded by the ball's *size* and `sc` by the ball's *slot weight*. The
caller does not have to name the ball exactly: any finite `A` containing
it will do, and the charge is read off `A`. -/

variable {D Q : ℕ → ℕ} {head tail : ℕ}

/-- **A vertex the search discovers at a positive distance is alive.**
The masked graph has no edge with a dead end, so a walk that arrives
anywhere but its own start arrives at a live vertex. This is what lets
the unwind know that the *only* discovered vertex that can be missing
from the queue is the source. -/

/-- **The search, paid for out of the ball.** The program is the landed
`bfsDrain`, unchanged; only the accounting is new. A turn still releases
`44` per slot of the block it scans and `40` for the vertex it retires,

potential behave — exactly where the landed walk used `sc ≤ ns` and
`tail ≤ n`. -/

/-! ### The engine

Three phases, and not one of them looks at the carrier: the seed, the
search, the unwind. -/

/-- **Block-driven breadth-first search, charged to its ball.** Handed a
block structure for `G`, a mask, a source, a distance array that already
holds the sentinel everywhere, and two output arrays, `bfsBlockCom d`
leaves

* the distance array holding the sentinel everywhere again — the same
  list it came in as, so the next centre may start at once;
* the ball in `q[0 .. tail)`, without repetition: the segment names
  exactly the live vertices within `d` of the source;
* their distances in `qd[0 .. tail)`, at the landed threshold reading.

The cost is `bfsBlockK bw nb` for any `A` containing the ball, `bw`
bounding its slot weight and `nb` its size. **Neither `n` nor `ns`
occurs**, and that absence is the whole point of the engine: the level
above may now run one of these per centre.

**Rebase G2/E6 (E4b's preferred fix).** Two facts this proof computes
were dropped at the final `refine` and re-derived by a full re-walk in
`Refine/ScatterBlockBfs.lean`; they are now IN the postcondition and
that re-walk is a one-line delegation:

* `σ'.vars "tail" ≤ nb` — the queue segment is charged to the *ball*,
  which is what lets a consumer walk it at block cost;
* `∀ i < σ'.vars "tail", Q i < n` — every queue entry is a vertex, which
  is what lets a consumer index an array by one. -/

/-! ### The charge, against the probe's honesty controls

`G2CostProbe`'s §5 reads every landed engine's cost as
`k * (weight + 1)` with `k` a numeral fixed before the input — `150` for
the cover's per-centre walk, `65` for the landed search, `200` for the
block leaves. The block engine's is `80`, and it is read against the
*ball's* weight rather than the carrier's: `s` members and `ds` slots,
which is `MassWeight.blockSize + blockRowSum`, which is
`slotWeight n (csrW n O)`, which is the `blockWeight` the cover's
per-centre obligation is stated in. -/

/-! ### Why the sentinel is not radius-free, and what it would take
(wave E4c-c, Part B — the dead end, recorded)

E4c-c asked whether the atom's remaining carrier pass — the per-atom
`fillCom "dist" (r + 1)` in `RamDriver.scatDeadCom` — could be removed
outright by making the "unvisited" sentinel radius-**independent**. Then
`ScatterBlock.ArenaA`'s seventh clause would stop naming the radius,
`unwind` would maintain it across atoms of different radii, and the fill
would hoist out of the atom instead of merely becoming touched-only.

**It cannot be done from this package, and the reason is structural.**
The sentinel *is* the depth cap. `RamBfs.scanSlot` relaxes on the single
test `dn < dist[w]`, and that one test does three jobs: it rejects an
already-discovered vertex, it rejects one discovered at this level, and
it caps the search — a vertex reached at depth `d` offers `d + 1`, which
does not beat the sentinel `d + 1` that an undiscovered vertex holds.
`radius_free_sentinel_breaks_cap` below is that mechanism as
arithmetic: at any radius-free sentinel `S > d + 1` the same offer
*passes*, so the search runs past the cap and its cost becomes the whole
reachable component rather than the ball — which is the one property
this engine exists to have (`bfsBlockK` names no `n` and no `ns`).

Restoring the cap needs an explicit `dn ≤ d` guard, i.e. **new control
flow inside `RamBfs.scanSlot`** — landed program text with
`seedSrc_run`, `expandRow_run`, `Queue.drain_run` and the whole
`Frontier` invariant over it. The array renaming that let E4c-c delete
the mask copy (`ScatterBlock.renCom_spec`) permutes array *names*; it
cannot introduce a test. So Part B is a `RamBfs` wave, not a
`Refine/Bfs*` one.

**And the second half would not pay even if the first were done.** With
a radius-free sentinel the fill hoists only as far as a state that
maintains it, and `RamDriver.coverPhase` — which runs at *every* level,
before that level's cluster loop — calls `RamCover.coverCom`, whose
search is the landed `RamBfs.bfsCom` with its own `initDist` and no
unwind: it leaves `"dist"` holding an arbitrary array
(`RamCover`'s postcondition is `∃ g, σ.arrs "dist" = arrOf n g`). So the
single initialization reaches level entry at best, never the root, and
is carrier-charged once per level. That is the trade
`Refine.C0CloseProbe`'s level-interface material exists to refuse: one
floor swapped for another. A wave that wants the fill gone has to take
the cover phase's search with it. -/

/-- **The sentinel is the cap.** A vertex reached at depth `d` offers
`d + 1`. Against the radius-dependent sentinel `d + 1` the offer fails
and the search stops; against any radius-free sentinel `S` above it the
offer succeeds and the search does not. This is the whole of why
`ScatterBlock.ArenaA`'s distance clause names the atom's own radius. -/

edges — `MassWeight.turn_size_refuted`'s shape for this engine. -/
