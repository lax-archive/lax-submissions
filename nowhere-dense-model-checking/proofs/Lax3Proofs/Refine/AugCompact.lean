# ND-MC G2/E2-aug — the compacted-arena augmentation round

The second engine family of `g2-cost-design` §6, on the template
`Refine/ElimCompact.lean` §9 wrote for it, and with the carrier install
shared with `Refine/SymCompact.lean` (`symSetCarrier`, one program for
all three families).

`RamAugment.augCom` is the round the ordering phase folds `R` times. It
reads the current orientation's in-lists out of `doff`/`dtg`, materializes
the fraternity graph in `off`/`tgt`, hands *that* to
`RamElim.elimCom`, and assembles the next orientation into `noff`/`ntg`.
`Refine/OrderEngineProbe.lean`'s coupling-table row 3 refuted the member
form of the two copies that feed it (`d1off`/`d1tg`: "the read-seam:
`symCom`'s offset fill and `forVerts` read `doff` at every carrier
vertex"), and its row 2 the member form of the mask copy. Both are
`augCom`'s seams too, and both die here for the same reason: at carrier
`mm` the copies are *prefix* copies of the compact view and the reads are
at carrier `mm`, so there is no non-member cell to read and no stale cell
to leave behind.

## What the wave had to discover, and did not have to do

`RamAugment.augCom` is **carrier-parametric**, exactly as
`RamElim.elimCom` and `RamDriver.symCom` were. Every one of its ten
passes is a `RamAugment.forVerts`, whose loop is
`.lt (.var "i") (.var "n")`; the sub-call is `elimCom`, itself
`"n"`-bounded (`ElimCompact`'s finding); and its landed Hoare triple
`RamAugment.ImplementsW` is **discharged** by
`RamDriverAugment.implementsW`, a theorem, which quantifies over that
carrier. So "augment at carrier `mm`" needs no re-synthesis whatever: set
`"n" := mm` and apply `RamAugment.augment_specW` at `n := mm`. Neither
the `AugmentSynth` nor the `ElimSynth` heartbeat ceilings were spent in
this file.

The obstruction is again the *length seam*, closed generically in
`ElimCompact` §3 (`bigStepB_padArrs`, `run_of_run_cutArrs`,
`tail_preserved`). This file imports those verbatim and supplies only its
own three pieces: a length schedule (`augClen`, twenty-six arrays), a
live-prefix entry surface (`AugPreC`, twenty-seven clauses), and one
`elimPreW_cutArrs`-shaped lemma (`augPreC_cutArrs`).

## The two hazards the brief named, and what happened to them

**GreedyFratRound's narrowing.** `RamAugment`'s docstring records the
counterexample: asked of *every* arc of `D'` on a fraternity edge the
greedy clause is **false** of this round, and it holds only of the arcs
added on fraternal grounds alone — one `D` did not carry and no
transitive link forced. `AugMemPost` (§6) carries
`GreedyFratRound D D'` as the landed `AugPost` states it, verbatim, and
carries the in-degree budget in the same guarded form
(`∀ d k', D.InDegLE d → LowDegreeVertices (fratGraph D) k' →
D'.InDegLE (d + d*d + k')`). Nothing is re-scoped; §8's bridge proves the
restatement is an equivalence at `mm = n`.

**The width.** This is where the family hit a residue; wave E2-width
closed it, and §5 compiles the closure in both directions.

* The *carrier* has left the width and the cost: the round's demand moves
  from `RamAugment.augWidth n d ≤ W` to the compact arena's own room, and
  its cost from `augCost n W` to `augCost mm W`.
* What was left inside `augWidth mm d = mm·(d+1)² + mm·mm + 1` was the
  `mm·mm` term, and it is **arena-quadratic**. `g2-cost-design` §3(a)'s
  repair is `augWidthE nv ks d := nv·(d+1)² + ks + 1`, which §5 defines,
  fits the fraternity graph into (`fratSlots_lt_augWidthE`), proves
  arena-affine (`augWidthE_le_weight`: `≤ (d+1)²·(w+1)`), and separates
  from `augWidth` on data by three orders of magnitude at a sparse arena.
  The capacity step the design flags — `m' ≤ ns` rather than `m' ≤ n²` —
  is re-discharged at the compact numbering from `arcs_le`
  (`arcs_le_compact`, `arcs_lt_augWidthE`), and `AugMemPost` carries that
  reading as a clause.
* **The substitution** (§4.0, §5.2). The round is not asked for a width
  at all: it is asked for the four capacities the walk actually spends
  (`AugRoom`), which `RamDriverAugment.implementsCore` had already been
  factored around. `augRoom_of_augWidth` is the landed width's way in —
  so nothing that compiled before stopped compiling — and
  `augRoom_of_augWidthE` the arena-affine one, at the degree budget shape
  `RamDriverCompose.fold_step` already discharges. §5.3.1 refutes both
  directions of the implication between the two widths, which is why the
  room takes a minimum and not one of them.

## What is *not* here

One walk is a named obligation (§9): `AugPreps`, that the eleven
preparation passes move the compact in-lists into the round's input arrays
and zero the nine arrays `RamAugment.AugPreW` asks zeroed, over the
compact prefix. It is refuted-before-proved on data in §2.3.

The scatter-back is **not** a new obligation: the round's per-vertex
answer is a rank array, so `ElimCompact.scatterCom` and
`ElimCompact.ScatterBacksW` are reused unchanged — one obligation for two
families, exactly as the template's item 3 predicted, and the satellite
discharging it (`ElimCompactWalks.scatterBacksW`, unconditional) discharges
this one's too. The carrier install is `SymCompact.symSetCarrier` and is
**walked**, not assumed.

Nothing here is `sorry`, and no theorem assumes `AugPreps` or
`ScatterBacksW` except `augCompact_spec`, which names them as hypotheses.

/-! ## §1 The program

Thirteen passes and one `Com`. Every bound is `"mm"` or the compact
in-list slot counter `"kd"`; the carrier scalar `"n"` occurs in exactly
two places, both inside the shared carrier install — and the second of
them is what makes the round's ten loops and its sub-call's five
arena-bounded. -/

/-- **The compact orientation into the round's input arrays.** The
phase's own relink (`copyUpto "ioff" "doff" (.add (.var "n") (.lit 1))`,
`copyUpto "itg" "dtg" (.var "lw")`) with both bounds moved to the arena.
This is `OrderEngineProbe`'s coupling row 3, in the form that survives:
a prefix copy, read back at carrier `mm`. -/
def augRelink : Com :=
  .seq (copyUpto "ioff" "doff" (.add (.var "mm") (.lit 1)))
    (copyUpto "itg" "dtg" (.var "kd"))

/-- **The nine arrays `RamAugment.AugPreW` asks zeroed, over the compact
prefix.** Three counting-sort accumulators (`ooff`, `off`, `noff`), the
sub-elimination's two (`bh`, `elm`), and the four stamps. The landed
phase zeroes all nine carrier-wide (`RamDriver.orderZeroCom`,
`augRelinkCom`, `augPrepCom`); here every fill is `mm`- or
`mm+1`-bounded. This is `OrderEngineProbe` §2's zero-seam with nothing to
catch — the re-zero is arena-class *and* a prefix fill, so no cell above
the prefix is left stale, which is exactly what the member re-zero could
not achieve. -/

level's block structure — as they do in the landed phase, which restores
them afterwards. In the compacted design that restore is an
arena-class *prefix* copy (`ElimCompact`'s `savePre`/`restorePre`), which

/-! ## §2 The compiled data

Refute-before-prove, on `TgtWidenProbe`'s witness instance: the star
`K₁,₄` oriented into its centre (`star5doff`/`star5dtg`, in-degree four),
carried as the **compact** in-lists of a five-member arena at the *odd*
vertices `1, 3, 5, 7, 9` of a carrier of any size, with a **sentinel**
above every compact prefix. `TgtWidenProbe.star5Wide` records the landed
round's answers on that orientation at carrier `5`: fraternity slots
`12`, greedy bound `3`, ten new arcs, and the block structure
`aug5doff`/`aug5dtg`. The compacted composite must produce exactly those,
scattered. -/

  every vertex of *its* carrier; at carrier `mm` that is the compact
  prefix, and the level's own mask at its dead vertices is still there
  when the round is done.
* `off` — the restore-seam (rows 1 and 4). The fraternity build writes
  `off[0..mm]` and `tgt[0..mf)` and nothing above either. -/

augments the sentinel; without the nine zeroing fills it has **no run at
all** — the sub-elimination's `elimLoop` pops flagged slots, drops every
one and reads `bh` out of range, which in IMP+ is stuck, not defaulted.
That is the D4 mechanism (`RamDriver.augPrepCom`'s docstring), and it is
what makes the zeroing half of the obligation refutable rather than
decorative. -/

/-! ## §4 The round at the arena's carrier

The landed walk, transported. `RamDriverAugment.augment_specWRoom` — a
theorem — is applied at `n := mm`. Nothing is restated and nothing is
re-synthesized. -/

/-! ### §4.0 The room the round spends

`RamAugment.augWidth mm d ≤ W` is not what the walk uses: it is a
*sufficient condition* that `RamDriverAugment.implementsW` immediately
takes apart into four capacity facts. Three of them — the carrier fits,
the input arcs' scan fits, the fraternity graph fits — live entirely in
the `mm·(d+1)²` term. The fourth is the assembly's write capacity, and it
is the **only** consumer of the arena-quadratic `mm·mm`.

`AugRoom` is the four facts themselves, with the fourth stated at the
sharper of the two bounds the assembly's own sum admits: the next block
structure has at most `mm · min mm (2d² + d)` slots — `mm` per vertex
generically (`RamDriverAugment.sum_augDeg_le`, the reading `mm·mm` pays
for) and `2d² + d` per vertex through the in-degree budget
(`sum_augDeg_le_deg`, `g2-cost-design` §3(a)'s degree-aware capacity,
re-discharged from `arcs_le`).

Asking the *room* rather than a named width is what lets **both** widths
reach the round: `augRoom_of_augWidth` is the landed reading and §5.2's
`augRoom_of_augWidthE`/`augRoom_of_augWidthE_slots` the arena-affine one.
Neither width implies the other — §5.3 refutes the implication that would
have made one of them redundant — so this is a genuine join and not a
restatement. -/

/-- **The four capacities one compacted round spends.** No carrier term,
and no `mm·mm` unless the caller's own width has one. -/
def AugRoom (mm d m W : ℕ) (D : Orientation mm) : Prop :=
  mm < W ∧ d * m ≤ W ∧ fratSlots D < W ∧ mm * min mm (2 * (d * d) + d) ≤ W

/-- **The assembly's write capacity**, from the room's fourth clause:
both readings of the `augDeg` sum are available, so the minimum of the
two is. This is the hypothesis `RamDriverAugment.implementsCoreR` asks
for, and the only place the width is spent on the round's *output*. -/
theorem AugRoom.cap {mm d m W : ℕ} {D : Orientation mm} (h : AugRoom mm d m W D)

/-- **The landed width supplies the room** — so every caller that held
`RamAugment.augWidth mm d ≤ W` still reaches the round, and
`augCompact_engine` below is strictly stronger than the reading that
asked for the width itself. The `mm·mm` term pays clause four and
nothing else. -/

/-- **The compacted round.** `RamAugment.augCom`, unchanged, at the
compact carrier `mm`, on a store whose arrays are the carrier's: it runs
at `RamAugment.augCost mm W` — a cost in which **the carrier does not
occur** — and leaves `RamAugment.AugPost`, the landed contract, verbatim,
of the compact view. The exit store is the view's answer over the tail the
call entered with, so the level's own mask and offsets above the compact
prefix come back untouched.

Two deltas of wave E2-width. The hypothesis is the *room* (§4.0), which
`augRoom_of_augWidth` supplies from the width this theorem used to ask
for and §5.2 supplies from the arena-affine one. And the conclusion
carries `RamElim.RnkLt mm τ`: the round's ranks are vertex numbers of the
compacted arena. `RamAugment.AugPost` drops that clause, and without it a
caller that reads a rank cell with an IMP+ `get` — the member scatter
does, `rnk[km]` — has **no derivation at all**, so the clause is not a
convenience but the difference between usable and vacuous. -/

/-! ### §5.2 The substitution: the arena-affine width supplies the room

`g2-cost-design` §3(a)'s substitution, executed. The round asks §4.0's
`AugRoom`, and these two lemmas are the arena-affine ways in — so a
caller may allocate `augWidthE` and never `augWidth`, and the `mm·mm`
term is gone from the round's demand and not merely from a reading of
it.

The two differ in where the assembly's `2d² + d` room comes from.

* `augRoom_of_augWidthE` takes it from the **degree parameter of the
  width**: the width is stated at a `db` that dominates `2d² + d`, and
  the round runs at in-degree `d`. This is exactly the chain's shape —
  `TgtCoupling.chainWidthE` is stated at the *last* round's budget while
  round `i` runs at `budget i`, and `TgtCoupling.two_sq_add_le_budget_succ`
  is the `hdb` this lemma asks for. It is the form
  `RamDriverCompose.fold_step` already discharges, now at the compact
  carrier.
* `augRoom_of_augWidthE_slots` takes it from the **slot term** instead,
  at a `ks` that already holds a fraternity graph (`mm · d²`, which is
  `RamAugment.fratSlots_le`'s bound). This is the form a single round
  gets when its allocation was sized for its own fraternity graph.

Both keep `augWidthE`'s arena-affine reading (`augWidthE_le_weight`):
the coefficient depends on the degree budget alone, never on `mm`. -/

/-! ### §5.3.1 Why the room takes the *minimum* — both directions refuted

`AugRoom`'s fourth clause is `mm · min mm (2d² + d) ≤ W`, and neither
half of the minimum can be dropped: the two widths supply *different*
halves and neither implies the other. -/

-- **Refuted**: the landed width does not supply the degree-aware
-- capacity. At two members and a degree budget of ten there is room for
-- `mm·mm = 4` new slots per the `mm·mm` term but the assembly's
-- degree-aware bound asks for `2·(2·100+10) = 420`.
#guard ¬ (2 * (2 * (10 * 10) + 10) ≤ augWidth 2 10)
-- **Refuted**: the degree-aware width does not supply the generic
-- capacity. A million members, an arena of two million slots and the
-- chain's budget `2·4² + 4 = 36`: the width is `1.371 · 10⁹` and
-- `mm·mm` is `10¹²`.
#guard ¬ (10 ^ 6 * 10 ^ 6 ≤ augWidthE (10 ^ 6) (2 * 10 ^ 6) 36)
-- … and at that same allocation the *room* holds — clauses one and four,
-- which are the two that see the width — while the landed width demand
-- `augWidth mm d ≤ W` is false by three orders of magnitude. This is the
-- substitution, on data: the round runs where `augWidth` said it could
-- not be allocated.
#guard 10 ^ 6 < augWidthE (10 ^ 6) (2 * 10 ^ 6) 36
#guard 10 ^ 6 * min (10 ^ 6) (2 * (4 * 4) + 4) ≤ augWidthE (10 ^ 6) (2 * 10 ^ 6) 36

/-! ### §5.4 The residue, closed

The wave that wrote §5.1–§5.3 delivered a *reading* and stopped at the
substitution, because `RamAugment.ImplementsW` — the landed Hoare triple
— asks its caller for `augWidth n d ≤ W` and derived its four internal
capacity facts from the `n·n` room. Wave E2-width closed it, and the
route was not to edit `RamAugment.augWidth` (still a read-only definition
of this file, and `C0Probe`'s floor record is about it) but to stop
asking for a *width* at all:

* `RamDriverAugment.implementsCore` had already been factored out of
  `implementsW` with the four capacities as explicit hypotheses — the
  width never enters the walk. `augment_specWRoom` is that core read at
  `RamAugment.AugPost`, and it is what §4 now calls.
* §4.0's `AugRoom` names those four facts at the compact carrier.
  `augRoom_of_augWidth` is the landed width's way in, so nothing that
  compiled before stopped compiling; §5.2's two lemmas are the
  arena-affine ways in, so `augWidthE` is now a width the round can
  actually be run at.
* The `m' ≤ n²` capacity step `g2-cost-design` §3(a) flags is
  `RamDriverAugment.sum_augDeg_le`; its degree-aware replacement
  `sum_augDeg_le_deg` re-discharges it from `arcs_le`, and `AugRoom.cap`
  is the one place both are consumed.

What is *not* closed here is the `nt` side: `augCompactCore` still runs
in a target array of a width `nt` the caller allocated, and
`augCompact_spec` still asks `kd ≤ W`. Those are slot counts, not
carrier terms, and they are arena-affine already. -/

/-! ## §6 The contract at the compacted arena

The round's contract, restated so that nothing in it ranges over the
carrier. The subject is an `Orientation mm` — the compacted arena's own
orientation, or an augmentation of it — the ranks are read at the
members' *arena* cells `ork[Mem j]` (which is what `scatterCom` writes),
and the block structure is read on the compact prefix. There is no
`∀ v < n`.

The two clauses that are *not* moved are the ones the brief warned about:
`GreedyFratRound D D'` and the in-degree budget keep the landed guards
exactly — the round's rule is for **new-fraternal arcs only**, and
widening either clause would be false of this round on
`RamAugment`'s own three-vertex counterexample. -/

/-- **The arena reading.** If the round's input orients the compacted
arena — which is what `ElimCompact.ElimMemPost`'s
`E.toGraph = memGraph G M hml` clause delivers at `R = 0` — then the
round's output *contains* the compacted arena: `AugStep.mono` keeps every
old arc, so every edge of `memGraph G M hml` is an edge of `D'.toGraph`.

This is the fact the phase's final elimination stands on
(`CoverDegree.exists_wreach_degree` reads `BackDegLE (D R).toGraph … k`
of the augmented graph, and the ordering it consumes has to cover the
level's own arena), now at the compacted arena and with no carrier
quantifier anywhere in it. -/

arena-affine**. That proviso is `chainWidthE ≤ bsq·(n+ns+1)`, the
design's own load-bearing width fact, and §5.3 records that supplying it
is E-width's edit and not this wave's. -/

identity, `"ork"` reading `"rnk"` (which is what `scatterCom` degenerates

/-- **Obligation E2-a/1 — the preparation walk.** `augPrepCom` moves the
compact in-lists into the round's input arrays and zeroes the nine arrays
`RamAugment.AugPreW` asks zeroed, over the compact prefix, at
`augPrepCost`, leaving the round's live-prefix entry surface and touching
no cell above the compact prefixes.

Refutable, and refuted-before-proved on data in §2.3: without the relink
the round augments the sentinel, and without the nine fills it has **no
run at all** (the D4 stuck mechanism at the sub-elimination's bucket
read).

The four word-bound antecedents are the ones a *copy* needs:
`Expr.evalB` refuses a value reaching `B`, so a copy of an over-bound cell
has no derivation and the obligation without them would be false rather
than hard. `SymCompact.prep_bounds_of_inCsr` supplies the last two from
the block structure itself, at `kd = m`. -/

/-- **Why the member list must be repetition-free.** If two members carry
the same arena number, the scatter's own conclusion asks one cell to hold
two ranks. This is the two-member core of
`ElimCompactWalks.not_scatterBacks_of_repeat`, at `AugMemPost`'s first
clause, and it is why `augCompact_spec` below takes `hsm` and consumes
`ElimCompact.ScatterBacksW` rather than the refuted `ScatterBacks`. -/

/-- **The compacted round implements the arena contract.** The two
obligations, the walked carrier install, §4's transported round, and
nothing else. Read the cost: `augCompactCost mm kd W` — the arena's live
vertex count, its compact slot count and the allocation width, and **no
carrier term**. Read the last clause: the level's own mask above the
compact prefix comes back exactly, which is `OrderEngineProbe` §4's
read-seam dead.

Three hypotheses of wave E2-width, and one obligation swapped.

* `h2` is `ElimCompact.ScatterBacksW`, not `ScatterBacks`. The latter is
  **compiled-refuted** (`ElimCompactWalks.not_scatterBacks_of_repeat`), so
  the earlier reading of this theorem stood on a `Prop` no caller could
  ever discharge; the repaired obligation has the same conclusion and is
  discharged unconditionally by `ElimCompactWalks.scatterBacksW`.
* `hsm` — the member list is strictly increasing, hence repetition-free.
  It is genuinely new: `hmlt` alone does not give it, and
  `no_scatter_at_repeat` above is the compiled proof that without it the
  conclusion's own first clause is unsatisfiable. Every landed caller
  holds it as `ScatterBlock.MemList.smono`, which is how the elimination
  side (`ElimCompact.elimCompact_spec`) supplies it.
* `hroom` (§4.0) replaces the width demand `augWidth mm d ≤ W`. It is
  strictly weaker — `augRoom_of_augWidth` derives it from that width —
  and §5.2 derives it from the arena-affine `augWidthE`, so the round is
  reachable at an allocation with no `mm·mm` term at all.

The scatter's two remaining antecedents are *derived*, not assumed: the
rank bound comes from §4's `RamElim.RnkLt` conjunct and the rank array's
length from the round's own `rnk = arrOf mm R`. Both are word-bound
facts, and without them `scatterCom`'s `get` on `rnk[km]` has no
derivation — the obligation would be vacuously unusable rather than
merely hard. -/
