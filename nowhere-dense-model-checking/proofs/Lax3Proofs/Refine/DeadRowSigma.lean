# The dead-row probe's Σ closure — split out of `Refine/DeadRowProbe.lean`

Wave R1.8-T3-flip (c1), the second import-order repair of this road.

`DeadRowProbe` §6 was the only part of that file that consumes
`Refine.G2ExistsRevalidation`, and that consumption put the whole probe
— and with it `Refine.ScatterDeadFold`, `Refine.ScatterDeadEngine` and
`Refine.ScatterDeadPass`, which all read the probe's mathematics —
**below** `Lax3Proofs.RamDriverRoot` in the import order, because
`G2ExistsRevalidation` imports `Refine.DriverRootD`. The dead-aware atom
program's walks then could not reach `RamDriverCluster.ScatterStep`,
which is the obligation they exist to discharge.

The §6 closure is a statement about *numbers*: it names no program and
no state, and nothing above it reads it. So it moves here, into a file
below the driver root, and the probe's mathematics —
`stepColoringP_subset`, `sat_outside_uniform`,
`exists_outside_in_prefix`, `deadRows_split` and
`no_coeff_pays_outsideRows` — stays above it, where the atom program
can consume it.

Nothing is restated. The theorem below is the one that stood in
`DeadRowProbe` §6, in the same namespace, so its fully qualified name
`Refine.DeadRowProbe.deadRow_interface_closes` is unchanged and the
reference to it from `Refine.KillListPass` still names the same fact.

This is the same repair as the road's first import-order defect (wave
(a1)'s walk, which sat below the driver it served, and was fixed by
splitting the file).

/-! ## §6 The Σ interface closes at the probed constants

`G2ExistsRevalidation.g2m_exists`, consumed at the incremental charge:

* the order and cover slots at the measured M-class law `68·m + 12`
  (`OrderSigProbeM`, unchanged);
* no dead slot — the per-level dead-sweep pass is gone, and its residual
  bookkeeping rides the turn rather than a fictitious phase budget;
* the turn coefficient at the constant this theorem is stated at,
  `200 + 84`: BlockLeaves' measured `200` plus the measured kill-time
  write at the probe's instance (`killClock 2 · 3 = 84` — three kills,
  two tables), the kill charge riding INSIDE the turn's size-read slot
  `turnCostSizeA`. **This is no longer the live constant.** Wave
  R1.8-T3-flip (a2) absorbed the kill *list* into the same slot, and the
  fit here was exact, so the live turn coefficient is
  `Refine.KillListPass.ctKL` and the live closure is
  `Refine.KillListPass.killList_interface_closes` — the same statement
  re-run there. Cite `ctKL`, not a numeral: the closure is indifferent
  to the coefficient's value (design §7, disposition F-4), which is why
  absorbing a charge moves a number and no interface;
* the base clause `Cb` generic — the base level is the member-list
  sweep plus the block-sized representative story (§3), both
  weight-linear; the `reprCost` floor that used to sit under
  `hKbase_gap` guarded the vestigial pass `tabled_isLocal` retires, and
  wave R1.8-T4a removed both (`Refine.BaseShed`), leaving the gap
  standing on the fold's carrier header alone.

The `#guard` pins the turn absorption at the empty block: the landed
leaf coefficient plus the whole measured kill write fit the slot's
`s = 0` reading. -/
