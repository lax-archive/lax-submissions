**The weighted mass mathematics** — ND-MC rebase G2, wave E5
(`plans/nowhere-dense-model-checking/g2-cost-design.md` §1, §2.6, §6-E5).

G2 replaces the carrier-blind size variable of the cost interface by ONE
size variable, the **arena weight**

    arenaWeight n H M = ∑_{v ∈ markSet n M} (1 + deg_H v)     (root: n + ns)
    blockWeight  … c  = ∑_{p ∈ block c}     (1 + deg_H (Xmem p))

and every phase budget is read at it (`G2CostProbe.orderCostA` &c.).
This file is the mathematics of that variable, and **nothing else**: no
program, no `Spec`, no cost function occurs below. It is the weighted
twin of the landed size mathematics —

| landed (size) | here (weight) |
|---|---|
| `RamDriver.arenaSize` | `arenaWeight` |
| `MassMath.blockSize` | `blockWeight` |
| `RamDriver.arenaSize_of_all_alive` | `arenaWeight_of_all_alive` |
| `ArenaBlock.ncard_clusterAt_le_blockSize` (the §5.3 descend clause) | `arenaWeight_le_blockWeight` |
| `MassMath.blockSize_eq_ncard` | `blockWeight_eq_wsum_clusterAt` |
| `MassAlive.aliveMass` / `aliveMass_le` | `aliveMassW` / `aliveMassW_le` |
| `ArenaBlock.mass_of_alive_compaction` | `mass_of_alive_compaction_weight` |

— and the landed proofs are threaded, not re-run: the descent's subset
step, `MassAlive`'s alive-homogeneity and `MassMath`'s block clauses all
enter as they stand.

# Why weights, and why the degree half is load-bearing

The recursion's coefficient is untouched by the change. The per-vertex
cover-degree bound `hdeg` that today gives `∑_c |X_c| ≤ D·(m+1)` gives
`∑_c blockWeight c ≤ D·(w+1)` by the same double count read with a
weight instead of a `1`: each vertex lies in at most `D` blocks, so its
`1 + deg v` is counted at most `D` times (`sum_wsum_le_mul_of_subset`,
the weighted `CoverDegree.sum_ncard_le_mul_of_subset`). What the weight
buys is that the *block-driven* engines — whose costs are sums over a
block's members AND over those members' arena slots (`BlockLeaves`'
`bexpK m d`, `d = degSum`) — are budgeted by one number:
`blockWeight = blockSize + degSum` exactly
(`blockWeight_eq_add_degSum`), which is why `blockDegSum_le_blockWeight`
closes B4c/N-2.

The degree half is not decoration, and §6 compiles the refutation: at a
star's centre block — one member, `D` slots — the landed leaf costs
exceed **every** budget read at the block's SIZE (`turn_size_refuted`),
while the same budget read at the block's WEIGHT clears
(`turn_weight_clears`). Sizes cannot bound the block-driven engines;
weights can.

# The two readings of a degree, and which one a consumer holds

`vdeg H v` is the mathematical degree (`{u | H.Adj v u}.ncard`) and
`csrW O v = 1 + Csr.rowLen O v` is the machine's — the compaction scan
adds `1 + (off[v+1] − off[v])` per alive member, one `aget` pair more
than the scan that today counts members. Under `RamElim.CsrSimple` the
two agree (`graphW_eq_csrW`), so `arenaWeight_of_all_alive_csr` reads
the root weight off the block structure as `n + ns` with no degree
argument at all. At a nested arena the weight may be read at the level's
own graph or at the parent's; `arenaWeight_masked_le` says the first is
never larger, so a budget granted at the parent's reading is granted at
either.

# Falsification

§6. Every authored inequality was checked on data before it was proved —
the star `K₁,₄` and a path, plus the campaign's degenerate covers (a
repeated block member, an empty block) — and three of the checks are
refutations: the size-only turn budget (above), the size-only mass
bound (`star_mass_size_refuted`: block weights do NOT sum below
`D·(arenaSize+1)`), and the descend clause without its subset
hypothesis.

A weight is a function `f : Fin n → ℕ` on the carrier; the two readings
the campaign uses are `graphW H = 1 + deg_H` and `csrW O = 1 + rowLen O`
(§2). Every lemma of §3–§5 is proved of a general `f` and then named at
`graphW`, so a consumer who holds the machine's reading rather than the
mathematical one instantiates the same statement. -/

/-! ### §4 The weighted mass

`MassAlive.aliveMass_le` bounds the total *size* of the live centres'
blocks by `d · (arenaSize + 1)`; its weighted twin bounds their total
*weight* by `d · (arenaWeight + 1)`, from the same hypotheses — the
cover pass's own postcondition, the block injectivity B3 landed, and
the cover-degree bound `hdeg`. Nothing new is asked of the program.

The engine is one double count, read with a weight instead of a `1`:
each vertex lies in at most `d` blocks, so its weight is counted at most
`d` times (`sum_wsum_le_mul_of_subset`, the weighted
`CoverDegree.sum_ncard_le_mul_of_subset`). -/

/-- **The weighted double count.** A family of sets inside `S`, no
vertex of which lies in more than `d` members, has total *weight* at
most `d · weight S`. At `f = 1` this is
`CoverDegree.sum_ncard_le_mul_of_subset`. -/

`BlockLeaves.bexpK m d` charges the block-driven expansion at the
block's size **and** at `d = degSum`, the number of arena slots the
block's members own; B4c left `degSum ≤ ns` unproved and named it
`ArenaBlock`'s to extend. The weight settles it without a summation
argument of its own, because the weight *is* the two numbers added:

    blockWeight = blockSize + blockDegSum        (exactly)

so a turn budgeted at its block's weight has paid both currencies. The
`≤ ns` form is the landed `RamBfs.CsrGraph.sum_rowLen_le` at the block's
members, whose distinctness is `MassMath.BlockInj`. -/

/-! #### The plug against the probe's proposed forms

`G2CostProbe` states its budgets at two free variables: an arena weight
`w` and a block weight `s` (`orderCostA b R w`, `turnCostSizeA ct ksc s
Kin`), plus the turn-leaf honesty control `blockLeaves_le_weight s ds ≤
200 · (s + ds + 1)` at a block's members `s` and its slots `ds`. The
three lemmas below are the arithmetic that says this file's definitions
are those variables — stated here rather than against the probe so that
the record file stays terminal in the import graph.

* `w := arenaWeight n G M` — at the root, `n + ns` (`arenaWeight_root`),
  which is the reading `g2_root_close` and the honesty controls use, and
  at any nested mask it is under that (`arenaWeight_le_root`);
* `s := blockWeight n G Xoff Xmem c` — and the probe's two block
  variables add up to exactly it (`probe_turn_budget_eq`), so
  `200 · (s + ds + 1)` IS `ct · (blockWeight + 1)` at `ct = 200`, the
  slot `turnCostSizeA` reads. -/

/-! ### §6 Falsification

Every inequality above was checked on data before it was proved. The
instances are the campaign's stock ones — the star `K₁,₄`, a path, and
the degenerate covers of `MassMath` (a block that repeats a member, an
empty block) — plus the **disjoint-star arena** on which the size
reading of the mass clause dies.

Three of the blocks below are refutations, and they are what says the
degree half of the weight is load-bearing rather than decorative:

* `turn_size_refuted` — **no** budget read at a block's SIZE bounds the
  landed block-driven leaf costs, at any coefficient;
* the `starCwt` guards — a cover whose blocks satisfy the landed size
  bound `∑ blockSize ≤ D·(size+1)` has block WEIGHTS above it, so the
  turn slot cannot be read at the arena's size;
* the repeated-member guards — `slotWeight_eq_wsum_clusterAt` cannot
  drop `BlockInj`, exactly as `MassMath.blockSize_eq_ncard` cannot. -/

section Falsification

/-! #### The arena of five disjoint `K₁,₄`s

Twenty-five vertices; every fifth one is a hub of degree four, the rest
are leaves of degree one. The radius-1 clusters are the closed
neighbourhoods, so every hub lies in five of them and every leaf in
two — a cover of degree `D = 5`. -/

/-- The degree of a vertex of the arena. -/
private def sDeg (v : ℕ) : ℕ := if v % 5 = 0 then 4 else 1

/-- Its weight, `1 + deg`. -/
private def sWt (v : ℕ) : ℕ := 1 + sDeg v

/-- The size of its cluster (the closed neighbourhood). -/
private def sCsize (v : ℕ) : ℕ := if v % 5 = 0 then 5 else 2

/-- And the weight of its cluster. -/
private def sCwt (v : ℕ) : ℕ := if v % 5 = 0 then 5 + 4 * 2 else 2 + 5

-- the arena's two numbers: twenty-five alive vertices, weight `65`
#guard (∑ v ∈ range 25, sWt v) = 65
#guard (∑ _v ∈ range 25, (1 : ℕ)) = 25

-- `arenaWeight_of_all_alive`, read on data: `w = n + ns` with
-- `ns = ∑ deg = 40` — and the same on the two stock instances, whose
-- weights agree because both have four edges
#guard (∑ v ∈ range 25, sWt v) = 25 + (∑ v ∈ range 25, sDeg v)
#guard (∑ v ∈ range 5, (1 + [4, 1, 1, 1, 1].getD v 0)) = 5 + 8      -- `K₁,₄`
#guard (∑ v ∈ range 5, (1 + [1, 2, 2, 2, 1].getD v 0)) = 5 + 8      -- the path `P₅`

-- the mass, both readings: the blocks' sizes and the blocks' weights

#guard (∑ v ∈ range 25, sCwt v) = 205

-- the landed SIZE bound holds at `D = 5` …
#guard (∑ v ∈ range 25, sCsize v) ≤ 5 * (25 + 1)

-- **Refuted**: the same bound read at the arena's SIZE does not carry
-- the blocks' weights, so a turn budget charged at the size cannot pay
-- the block-driven engines. This is the mass-clause half of the
-- design's "one size variable" decision.
#guard ¬ ((∑ v ∈ range 25, sCwt v) ≤ 5 * (25 + 1))

-- … while at the arena's WEIGHT it clears — `aliveMassW_le` on data.
#guard (∑ v ∈ range 25, sCwt v) ≤ 5 * ((∑ v ∈ range 25, sWt v) + 1)

-- the descend clause on data (`arenaWeight_le_blockWeight`): the hub's
-- sub-arena is inside the hub's block and weighs less …
#guard sWt 0 ≤ sCwt 0
#guard sCwt 0 = 13

-- **Refuted** without the subset hypothesis: an arena that is *not*
-- inside the turn's block is not bounded by it, so the clause cannot
-- drop `hsub`.
#guard ¬ ((∑ v ∈ range 25, sWt v) ≤ sCwt 1)

-- `blockWeight_eq_add_degSum` on the hub's block: five members owning
-- eight arena slots weigh thirteen.
#guard 5 + (4 + 4 * 1) = sCwt 0

-- **Refuted**: a block that lists vertex `0` three times weighs three
-- times its cluster, so `slotWeight_eq_wsum_clusterAt` cannot drop
-- `BlockInj` — the same finding `MassMath`'s falsification block
-- compiles for sizes.
#guard (∑ _p ∈ range 3, sWt 0) = 15
#guard ¬ ((∑ _p ∈ range 3, sWt 0) ≤ sWt 0)

-- an empty block weighs nothing, at either reading
#guard (∑ p ∈ Finset.Ico 7 7, sWt p) = 0
#guard blockSize (fun _ => 7) 3 = 0

/-! #### The negative control the design asks for: sizes cannot budget
the block-driven leaves

`G2CostProbe.blockLeaves_le_weight` fits the landed B4c exports —
`blockLoadK`, `bandK`, `bsubK`, `bexpK` — under `200 · (s + ds + 1)`,
the block's WEIGHT. Read at the block's SIZE alone the same costs fit
**no** coefficient: a star's centre block has one member and as many
arena slots as the centre has neighbours, and `bexpK`'s `30 · degSum`
grows with them while `ct · (size + 1)` does not. -/

/-- **The refutation, for every coefficient**: at a one-member block
owning `ct` slots the landed leaf costs exceed `ct · (size + 1)`. So
the turn slot of `G2CostProbe.turnCostSizeA` must be read at the block
weight; `blockSize` cannot serve. -/

the instance the refutation above is stated against. -/
