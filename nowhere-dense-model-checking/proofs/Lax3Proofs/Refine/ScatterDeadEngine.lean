# The engine's count, exported — the E4 dead fold meets the machine

`ScatterDeadFold.scatVal_fold` splits a scatter atom's answer into three
terms: the greedy count of the *alive* part of the atom's set, the kill
bits, and the outside class's bit times its count. The landed active-set
engine (`Refine.ScatterBlock.scatBlock_specW`) decides only a threshold
flag about the one set it walks, so the two dead terms — runtime
scalars, unknown at construction time — cannot be folded into the
threshold literal of the program text. What CAN carry them is the
engine's own counter: the scan leaves `"cnt"` holding the greedy count
capped at the threshold, and the capped count decides `t ≤ count + e`
for **every** additive term `e` — that is `cnt_decides` below, and
`scatVal_of_cnt` is the atom's answer assembled from it.

## The falsification first

The naive export — `cnt` IS the greedy count — is **false**: the scan
stops counting at the threshold. The two compiled gates below run the
engine on `ScatterBlockDiff`'s five-vertex arena (greedy count three)
and watch the counter: at threshold `2` the machine reports `2`, not
`3`. The `∀ e` form is exactly what survives the cap, and the second
gate (`threshold 4`, counter `3`) is the uncapped control.

/-! ### §2 The export

`scatBlock_specW`'s own proof, re-run with the counter kept in the
postcondition. The landed flag clauses are unchanged; what is new is
`cnt ≤ t` and the `∀ e` decision clause, read off the scan invariant's
exit disjunction (`ProgressA` at the end of the carrier): either the
counter hit the threshold — then both sides of the biconditional are
true outright — or the scan ran out of members and the counter is the
whole greedy count (`selBelow_all`). -/

/-- **The active-set pass, with its counter.** Identical hypotheses and
program as `Refine.ScatterBlock.scatBlock_specW`; the postcondition
keeps `"cnt"`, which decides the threshold against the greedy count
*plus any additive term* — the shape the dead fold consumes. -/

/-! ### §2b The same export, at a mask array the caller names

**Wave E4c-c: the calling-convention copy dies here.** Until this wave
the driver had to move the child's alive array into `"alv"` before it
could enter the engine, because the engine's mask name was a literal —
a `12·n + 6` carrier walk that computed nothing, and whose scratch
destination could not be cleaned without a driver-wide discipline
(`Refine.ScatterDeadPass.mask_junk_flips_the_engine` is what running it
dirty costs). The engine below reads its mask out of whatever array the
caller names, so there is no copy and no scratch to leave junk in.

Nothing about the engine is re-proved: `ScatterBlock.scatBlockComA` is
the landed program under an array renaming and
`ScatterBlock.renCom_spec` carries `scatBlockCnt_specW` across whole,
charge included. What the caller owes instead is
`ScatterBlock.MaskFree av` — that the mask is none of the seven names
the pass itself holds. That is a genuine precondition of reading in
place, not an artefact: at `av = "dist"` the engine's own sentinel fill
would erase the mask. -/

/-! ### §3 The atom's answer, assembled

The lynchpin of flag F-1: the engine's counter at the atom's *alive*
part, the kill scalar and the outside scalar decide `ScatVal` — no term
of which reads a row outside `alive ∪ kills`. The two scalar hypotheses
are what the kill-list walk and the outside probe leave
(`ScatterDeadFold.outside_ncard_of_probe` /
`outside_ncard_of_empty` turn the probe's bit into `oc`). -/
