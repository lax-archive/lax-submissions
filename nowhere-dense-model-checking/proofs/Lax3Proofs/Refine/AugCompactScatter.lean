# ND-MC G2/E2-width — the compacted augmentation round on real discharges

`Refine/AugCompact.lean`'s `augCompact_spec` used to name two obligations
and a width. One of the obligations — `ElimCompact.ScatterBacks` — was
**compiled-refuted**, so the theorem was dead capital: no caller could
ever produce its second hypothesis. The width was
`RamAugment.augWidth mm d ≤ W`, whose `mm·mm` term is arena-quadratic and
is the one thing `g2-cost-design` §3(a) exists to remove.

This satellite is the composed reading with both closed, and it exists so
that the closure is *seen* rather than argued:

* the scatter obligation is supplied, not assumed —
  `ElimCompactWalks.scatterBacksW` is unconditional, with no hypothesis on
  `B`, `n`, `mm` or `Mem` at all, and the two member-list clauses
  `augCompact_spec` needs come out of one `ScatterBlock.MemList`, which is
  what every caller of the package already carries;
* the width is `AugCompact.augWidthE mm kd db` — the arena's own live
  vertex count and slot count, and a degree budget, with **no `mm·mm` and
  no carrier term**. `AugCompact.augWidthE_le_weight` reads it as
  `(db+1)² · (w+1)` at the arena's weight `w = mm + kd`, which is
  `g2-cost-design` §1's arena-affine shape with the coefficient depending
  on the degree budget alone.

`db` is the *next* round's in-degree budget, and `hdb` is the inequality
`TgtCoupling.two_sq_add_le_budget_succ` proves of the chain's budget
recursion: a fold that allocates at `chainWidthE`'s last budget and runs
round `i` at `budget i` has `hdb` for free, which is how
`RamDriverCompose.fold_step` already discharges the same two capacities
at the carrier.

What is left is one obligation, `AugCompact.AugPreps` — the eleven
preparation passes — and it is the E2-prep wave's.

/-- **The compacted augmentation round, at the arena-affine width and
with the scatter discharged.** `AugCompact.augCompact_spec` with its
second obligation supplied by `ElimCompactWalks.scatterBacksW`, its two
member-list clauses read off a `MemList`, and its room supplied by
`AugCompact.augRoom_of_augWidthE` — so the allocation the caller has to
make is `augWidthE mm kd db`, in which the carrier does not occur and the
arena occurs linearly.

Everything else is verbatim `augCompact_spec`: the cost
`augCompactCost mm kd W`, the contract `AugMemPost` at the compacted
arena, and the level's own mask above the compact prefix handed back
untouched. -/

/-! ## The separation, at the corollary's own parameters

The two allocations `augCompact_specE` and `augCompact_specW` ask for, at
a million-member arena of two million compact slots whose round runs at
in-degree four (so `db = 2·4² + 4 = 36`). The affine one is `1.373 · 10⁹`;
the quadratic one is `1.000 · 10¹²`, seven hundred times larger, and all
of the difference is the `mm·mm` term. -/

#guard augWidthE (10 ^ 6) (2 * 10 ^ 6) 36 = 1371000001
#guard Lax3Proofs.RamAugment.augWidth (10 ^ 6) 4 = 1000025000001
#guard 700 * augWidthE (10 ^ 6) (2 * 10 ^ 6) 36 ≤ Lax3Proofs.RamAugment.augWidth (10 ^ 6) 4
-- the affine reading of the width the corollary asks for: `(db+1)²·(w+1)`

#guard augWidthE (10 ^ 6) (2 * 10 ^ 6) 36 ≤ 37 ^ 2 * (3 * 10 ^ 6 + 1)
