# ND-MC rebase G2/E-order — the order phase's carrier floor, compiled,
and the no-escape theorem

Wave E-order was tasked with discharging the ordering phase at the
arena-charged cost `G2CostProbe.orderCostA` and re-threading the root's
`hKo` slot to the §2.1 form, closing `g2_plug`'s `hKo` implication.
**This file is the wave's honest compiled verdict: the discharge is not
reachable from the landed package by any interface move, because the
program half is missing at every pass.** Three findings, each compiled:

1. **The overcharge, on data** (§1 — the wave's falsification gate).
   The CURRENT `RamDriver.orderCom` text is run through
   `TgtWidenProbe.execC` at a two-vertex arena inside a 100- and a
   200-vertex carrier, and at the empty arena. The clock is affine in
   the CARRIER at a fixed arena — `650·n + c` at `R = 0`, `1455·n + c`
   at `R = 1` — and the whole arena's own share of a 100-carrier run is
   `496` of `66 146`. The concrete twin of `G2CostProbe.hKo_gap`: the
   200-carrier clock refutes `orderCostA` read at the arena's weight
   `4`, and the SAME clock fits `orderCostA` read at the root weight
   `202` — the mismatch is purely the reading point. The empty-arena
   clock is `Ω(n)`, so no budget for THIS text can have the
   `O(1)`-class empty-arena charge that `hKo_gap`'s route needs dead:
   the repair is a program delta, not a sharper walk of the same text.

2. **The no-escape theorem** (§2). Against the REAL slot shapes of
   `RamDriverRoot.levelAt` — its `hKs` at `turnCostSize` and its
   Σ-shaped `hKl`, byte for byte — ANY budget family whose level-1
   order slot charges even `c` on the EMPTY arena has root cost
   `≥ m·(c + 11)` at every root weight `m`
   (`nested_emptyCharge_floor`). Corollary `emptyCharge_route_dead`:
   at the probe's own ε = 1 numerals a `1·n` empty-arena charge —
   1600× below the landed budget's carrier coefficient — already
   exceeds the `g2_exists` closed form at `n = 10¹¹`, generically in
   the formula and the turn-cost family. So the §4-fallback of the
   wave brief ("weakest sufficient form") is PINNED: every solvable
   `hKo` form is `O(1)`-class on the empty arena, i.e. is
   `orderCostA`-class; there is no interface between the landed
   carrier form and the arena form. The program half is unavoidable.

3. **The after-side control** (§3). The member-list pattern the
   interior must adopt EXISTS in the package and is carrier-free on
   the same instrument: E4b's `Refine.ScatterBlock.clearMem` (walks
   `mem[0..mm)`, clears exactly the listed cells, `MemList`
   sound/complete vocabulary, budget `clearMemK mm = 25·mm + 12`)
   clocks **34 at `n = 100` and 34 at `n = 200`** at two members —
   against the order text's `+650` per carrier vertex. The revision
   target is compiled as a differential the successor wave must
   reproduce pass by pass.

## Why the program half exceeds one wave (the E6-survey scope, sharpened)

Every pass of `orderCom R j` is carrier-bounded: `saveCsr`/`restoreCsr`
and the `ioff → doff` copy walk `n + 1` offset cells; the mask copy,
the rank inversion, the `alv` fill and the eight zeroing fills of
`orderZeroCom` walk `n`; `symCom`'s offset fill walks `n + 1` and
`forVerts` walks `n`; the two `RamElim.elimCom` entries and each
`augRoundCom` (three prep fills at `n`/`n + 1`, `RamAugment.augCom`,
nine relink passes at `n`/`n + 1`) scan the carrier. The E2b live-width
copies (`gtg`/`dtg`/`ntg` at `"lw"`) are the ONLY arena-driven walks in
the phase. There is no member list to drive the rest with: R1.6 is
unbuilt — `LevelPre` threads masks, not member lists, and no phase
produces one (building it from the mask is itself a carrier scan, so it
must be handed down by the parent's descend pass, which enumerates the
block's members already).

## The exact next surface (the successor waves' brief, in order)

1. **Member-list threading** (driver-stack wave): `LevelPre` gains a
   member-list clause (`memName j` array + alive-count scalar, dense
   prefix, `MemList`-sound/complete against the mask);
   `RamDriverDescend`'s child-mask writes also emit the child's member
   list; every phase's frame section carries the new names.
2. **Member-driven engines** (one wave per family, the E6 survey's
   scope): elimination (`RamElim.elimCom`'s init scan and bucket walk
   at the member list — the bucket-pointer walk needs the amortized
   reading), augmentation rounds + relink/prep bookkeeping at the
   member list and the live width, symmetrization, and the phase's
   fills via the `clearMem` pattern (§3). The `n + 1`-cell offset
   walks die only with the compacted arena CSR (design §3(c)).
3. **The phase text + walk** (E-order re-run): `orderCom` rebuilt from
   the member-driven passes, `OrderImplementsRL` re-discharged at
   `orderCostA (bsq d D₁ R) R (arena weight)`, `levelAt`'s `hKo` at the
   §2.1 form, `g2_plug`'s `hKo` implication deleted. The gate:
   this file's §1 clocks re-run against the new text must drop to
   arena-affine, and the §1 refutation guard must flip.

Nothing here edits a frozen surface; the landed `orderImplements₀` /
`orderImplementsR` stand — sound, carrier-charged — and the §1 sanity
guards check the landed budgets still cover the text's clock.

/-! ### §1 The overcharge, on data (the falsification gate)

The instrument is E2b's cost-carrying interpreter
`TgtWidenProbe.execC`; the instances are the brief's: a two-vertex
arena — vertices `0, 1` joined by one edge, arena weight
`(1 + 1) + (1 + 1) = 4` — inside carriers of 100 and 200 vertices
(every other vertex dead and isolated, `ns = 2`, `m = 1`), and the
empty arena (`ns = m = 0`). The states are `TgtWidenProbe.ordStAt`'s
shape at a parametric carrier: the level's CSR in `off`/`tgt` (the
target array at the allocation width `W`), the reserved pair, the
depth-0 masks, and the engines' scratch fresh from `augSt`. `W = 8`
at `R = 0`; `W = 40` at `R = 1` (room for the round's chain, as
`ordStAt`'s `K₁,₄` gate needs at width 64 for `n = 5` — the double
star's chain; the light arena's chain is small). -/

/-! ### §2 The no-escape theorem

`RamDriverRoot.levelAt`'s two Σ-interface slots, byte for byte — `hKs`
at `turnCostSize` (whose `Kin` summand is the nested level's own
budget) and the Σ-shaped `hKl` — force any empty-arena order charge to
multiply into the root by the block count. The derivation is the
C0Probe floor's route with everything stripped but the one load it
needs: `t := m` empty blocks (`bs := 0` satisfies every mass bound),
each block's turn contains the level below it, and the level below
pays its order slot on the empty arena. -/

/-- **Any empty-arena order charge multiplies into the root.** Against
the real slot shapes, a budget family whose level-1 order slot pays
`Ko 1 0` on the empty arena has root cost at least `m · (Ko 1 0 + 11)`
at every root weight `m`. (With `Ko 1 0` of the order of `n` — which
§1 shows the current text forces on every budget that covers it — this
is the `Ω(n²)` floor; with `Ko 1 0` constant it is harmless, which is
exactly `orderCostA`'s empty-arena reading,
`G2CostProbe.emptyArena_charge_const`.) -/

carrier coefficient — and still closes to the `g2_exists` witness's
budget, at the probe's own ε = 1 numerals read at `n = 10¹¹`. Every
solvable `hKo` form is therefore `O(1)`-class on the empty arena —
