# ND-MC rebase P2 / satellite 2G — `expandCom`, the nested expansion,
re-derived through the refinement tower

`RamDriver.expandCom msk src dst` is one step of neighbourhood expansion
of a vertex set inside the arena a mask cuts out: a flat pass over the
carrier whose body, at a **live** vertex, loads the vertex's block and
scans it for a live marked neighbour. It is the pass both chains of a
cluster are built from — the ball of the descent (D6, `2·cap`
instances), the padded batch profiles (C2, `mb·cap`) and the colour-class
profiles (C3, `(sigL+1)·cap`) — and after satellite 2F it was the **last
underived program shape on the `C0` path** (2F/N-1).

It is derived here: abstract program, twin, bound, synthesis, and the
bridge into `RamDriverCluster.expandVal`'s vocabulary.

## 0. The reduction — what `expandCom` runs, and against what

| # | machine | shape | here |
|---|---|---|---|
| E1 | `.assign "z" (.lit 0)`; `.while (z < n)` | the carrier pass | §3 `expPass` |
| E2 | `.assign "hit" (.get src (.var "z"))` | one `aget` | §3 |
| E3 | `.ite (0 < msk[z]) (…) .skip` | the branch **containing a loop** | §3 |
| E3a | `Csr.loadRow "off" "z" "j" "jend"` | **three** IR ops (2F/D-b) | §3 |
| E3b | `Csr.scan "j" "jend" (expandSlot msk src)` | the block scan | §2 `expScan` |
| E4 | `.store dst (.var "z") (.var "hit")` | one `aset`, in **both** arms | §3 |
| E5 | `.assign "z" (.add (.var "z") (.lit 1))` | the bump | §3 |

and one slot `RamDriver.expandSlot msk src` of E3b is `w := tgt[j]`,
`if 0 < msk[w] then (if 0 < src[w] then hit := 1)`, `j := j + 1`.

The shape is `ElimSynth.degPass`'s — an outer carrier pass with an inner
row scan and an `aset` branch — with one difference that matters: **the
scan sits inside the branch**, because a dead vertex must *not* be
expanded into (`RamDriverDescend.expandVal_of_dead`), where the degree
pass scans unconditionally and only the write is guarded. That is
`ElimSynth2.fillRowF`'s shape, which tool wave T1 made translatable
(`fillSynth`), so nothing here is a matcher gap.

## 2G/D-a — the hit flag is a **count**

The machine's inner loop sets `hit := 1` and leaves it. At this layer a
scalar carried by a loop lives in one cell and the only rules that write
it are the *in-place* ones (`mopSucc`, `mopAddIn`, `mopKeep`,
`mopPred`) — there is no rule that overwrites an owned cell with the
contents of another, by design (the `mopKeep` finding: a copy moves the
accumulator out of its cell and the branch merge junks it). So
`hit := 1` is not expressible, and the two arms of the slot's branch
would have to deliver two different cells.

The pass therefore **counts** the live marked neighbours instead of
flagging them: the slot's branch is `ElimSynth.degF`'s exactly —
`mopSucc` against `mopKeep` — and the row's *own* branch turns the count
into the machine's value, `1` when the count is positive and `src[z]`
when it is not. `0 < count ↔ ∃ slot naming a live marked vertex`, which
is §4's `hitUpto_pos`, so the value written is `RamDriverCluster.expandVal`
on the nose and only the scratch cell's contents differ from the
machine's. Same deviation class as 2B′/D-a (`ls` dropped) and 2B′/D-b
(`max` without a branch): the *values the pass reports* are identical,
and §1's differential guards are what check it.

## 2G/D-b — the cost goes from quadratic to linear in `ns`

`RamDriverDescend.expandCom_spec` charges `(24·ns + 44)·n + 6`: its walk
bounds *every* vertex's block scan by the whole target array, because
`Csr.rowScan_spec` is applied at the constant `24·ns + 4`. The tower's
bound is the two-currency energy `ElimSynth`'s degree pass runs on —
`E2 (iter expRowC) (iter expC) (n − z) (off[n] − off[z])` — so the scan
turns are the **blocks, which tile the target array**, and the closed
cost is `47·n + 30·ns + 4`. Linear where the baseline is quadratic; §10
puts the two numbers side by side. This is the same touched-only
harvest 2F took on `clusterLoad` (2F/D-a), at the pass 2F left behind.

## 2G/D-c — a dead vertex still pays for its branch

`expRowC` is charged at every vertex, live or dead, and the `r • iter expC`
term is charged at the block length whether the block was scanned or
not. Both are `≤`-bounds and the dead vertex pays strictly less than
its account, so nothing is lost; it is recorded because the *shape* of
the account (one `expRowC` per carrier cell) is what makes the chain of
`2·cap` expansions `Θ(cap·(n + ns))` per cluster, and no mask can make
it sublinear. The touched-only repair for the ball chain — expanding a
*frontier* rather than the whole carrier — is a change to the machine
program and is named in §11.

## What is consumed rather than re-proved

`ElimSynth2.while_pot_le`/`step_spec` carry both loops; `ElimSynth`'s
`Shape`, `getElem!_arrOf` and the `liveUpto` idiom are the model for
§4's `hitUpto`; `RamDriverCluster.expandVal`, `expandVal_of_dead` and
**`hit_eq_expandVal`** — the whole graph mathematics of the pass — are
consumed by §9 and not restated. `RamDriverDescend`'s walk is not
touched.

## House traps observed

`omega` is blind through `Ir.Val` and through tuple projections (`show`
first); `decide +kernel` for the numerals; never `simp [Codegen.embed]`;
junk cells are digit-free and consumed in written order; loop states are
assembled with `mopPair` and never as literal tuples.

/-! ## 1. Refute before prove

The pass as a computable function, run on an arena where the answer is
independently known, and the readings pinned. The hot spots:

* **the mask cuts the arena at *both* ends of an edge** — a dead vertex
  is not expanded into (`expandVal_of_dead`) *and* a dead neighbour does
  not expand anything. Both halves are checked, and both negative
  controls are exhibited.
* **one step is a step, not a closure** — radius `2` differs from radius
  `1` on a path, which is what makes `chainCom`'s fold observable.
* **the destination is a union, not a frontier** — a marked vertex stays
  marked (`hit := src[z]` first). The frontier reading is exhibited and
  refuted.
* **the source's value rides through** — at an unexpanded vertex the
  cell is `src[z]` and not `0`, so a source above `1` survives. This is
  what `expandVal_eq_or` needs and a "write the indicator" reading would
  break.

existential: the slots already passed that name a live marked vertex,
counted rather than flagged (2G/D-a). `hitUpto_pos` is the equivalence
that makes the count and the flag the same test, and it is the only
place the deviation has to be argued. -/

/-! ## 10. The cost, against the hand-walked pass

`RamDriverDescend.expandCom_spec` proves the machine program at
`(24·ns + 44)·n + 6`. The tower's is `47·n + 30·ns + 4`.

| | hand-walked | tower |
|---|---|---|
| per carrier cell | `24·ns + 44` | `47` |
| per block slot | — (charged `ns` per cell) | `30` |
| whole pass | `(24·ns + 44)·n + 6` | `47·n + 30·ns + 4` |

The per-cell and per-slot excesses are 2E/D-b's standing deviation (a
cell expression of `k` reads is `k` `aget`s plus one operation per
connective, and a loop state of `k` components pays `k − 1` `skip`s per
turn, 2B′/F-a). **The `n·ns` is not**: the baseline's walk bounds every
vertex's block by the whole target array, and the tower's energy charges
the block's own length, so what was quadratic per pass is linear
(2G/D-b). Over a chain of `2·cap` expansions the difference is
`Θ(cap·n·ns)` against `Θ(cap·(n + ns))`. -/

/-! ## 11. Debts, named

**2G/N-1 — the chain is not composed.** `RamDriver.chainCom` is
`foldRange (expandCom msk (nm a) (nm (a+1))) r`, and what is derived
here is one turn of that fold. Composing `r` of them at this layer is a
*name* problem and not a program problem: consecutive stages must be
distinct cells (`RamDriver.ballStage` alternates two, the colour chains
run through `cap + 1`), and the tower's cell names are literals, so a
chain of length `r` is `r` instantiations of `expSynth` at `r + 1`
names — which is the pinned boundary's name generation and belongs to
the integration wave, exactly as `ClusterSynth` §6 states for the
per-depth names. The mathematics of the fold (`chainCom_succ`,
`ballOf_nbhd`, `chainCom_stages`) is `RamDriverDescend`'s and is
consumed, not re-proved.

**2G/N-2 — no `BRefine` coverage** (2F/N-5 at this pass). Every bound
(`n`, `jend`) is a runtime cell entering as an `ℕ`, and the count `hct`
is a *new* quantity the machine does not carry: it is bounded by the
block's length and so by `ns`, which is below the word bound in every
caller, but nothing here proves it. `ScatterSynth` §15's `ScanBounded`
is the pattern; the nested loop needs the rule `ElimSynth3`'s debt E3
names as missing (`BRefine.while_guard` takes a body, not a body
containing a loop).

**2G/N-3 — the carrier pass is not touched-only, and cannot be made so
here.** 2G/D-c: `expRowC` is paid at every vertex whether or not the
mask keeps it, so a chain of `2·cap` expansions costs `Θ(cap·n)` per
cluster even when the ball is a constant-size set. The repair is a
*frontier* representation — expand a list of marked vertices rather than
the carrier — which is a change to the machine program (`RamDriver`),
not to this file, and it is the same shape of repair 2F/D-a names for
`clusterLoad`'s fill. Recorded together with it.

/-! ## 13. Telemetry (the wave's acceptance numbers)

| item | number |
|---|---|
| passes derived here | 2 (the block scan, and the whole pass containing it) |
| syntheses | 2, both at 1 000 000 heartbeats |
| `expScanSynth` (inner loop alone) | ≈ 0.7 s |
| `expSynth` (outer + inner, branch containing the loop) | ≈ 2.6 s |
| file wall clock, cold | ≈ 26 s |
| widest state | 2 components (both loops) |
| `#guard`s | 45 |
| `#guard_msgs` blocks (negative controls + axiom checks) | 8 |
| refuted authored statements | 0 |
| sorries | 0 |
| axioms | `propext`, `Classical.choice`, `Quot.sound` only |

**2G/M-a — the branch containing a loop is cheap when the state is
narrow.** `ElimSynth2.fillSynth` — the same shape at a three-component
state — needed 4 000 000 heartbeats when it first landed; this one, at
two components, translates in 1 000 000 and under three seconds. Taken
with 2B′/M-a's ≈ 90 s at eleven components, the tool's cost is governed
by the *state width* and not by the nesting depth, which is the
datapoint the rebase plan wanted before committing the remaining
per-depth shapes to the tower. -/
