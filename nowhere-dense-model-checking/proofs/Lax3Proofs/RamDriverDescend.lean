/-!
The passes of one cluster of `Lax3Proofs.RamDriver`, walked: the
padding, and the expansion the two chains of a cluster are built from.

This file is stage three of the driver. It carries the walks of
`RamDriver.enumBatch` and of `RamDriver.expandCom`/`chainCom` — the
first is a whole obligation of `Lax3Proofs.RamDriverCluster`, the second
is what the descent's ball and the colouring's three slot families are
each an instance of — together with the three transport lemmas a pass
needs to hand a depth's state on.

# What is proved

* `enumBatch_spec`, the padding pass: the buffer ends holding exactly
  `mb` entries, every one a vertex BOTH the batch and the cluster mark,
  and every such vertex among them (wave R1.8-T3-flip (c2a) — the
  cluster guard; the verdict that put it there is
  `Refine.ScatterDeadPass` §0b). Its content is a counting argument —
  `markedBelow` and `count_lt_of_mark` at the product cell — that the
  collecting loop never overruns the buffer, and `PadInv` for the
  repetition that follows.
* `enumStepW`, that pass at the surface `RamDriverCluster.EnumStep`
  states it at, and `enumStep_of_maskWords`, which turns it into the
  obligation itself from one clause about the batch indicator.
* `expandSlot_step`, `expandStep_spec`, `expandCom_spec`: one step of
  neighbourhood expansion, the inner block scan against
  `Csr.rowScan_spec` with `RamDriverCluster.ScanHit`, the outer pass
  against `Refine.SigmaLoop.forRangeZeroSum` with
  `RamDriverCluster.ExpandInv`, and
  `RamDriverCluster.hit_eq_expandVal` at the join.  The live scan
  invariant retains the row's lower endpoint, so the per-row charges
  telescope to the CSR target length instead of multiplying that length
  by the carrier size.
* `chainCom_spec`, the chain of `r` of them: the last name of the
  family marks the `r`-neighbourhood of what the first one marked. The
  induction peels the chain from the *front*, which is what the syntax
  of `RamDriver.foldRange` gives (`chainCom_succ`), so the radius
  arithmetic it needs is `ballOf_nbhd` and not
  `RamDriverCluster.nbhd_ballOf`. The family of names is a parameter:
  the ball's chain alternates between two names
  (`RamDriver.ballStage`) and the colour chains run through distinct
  ones, and both are instances.
* `levelPre_congr`, `coverHeld_congr`, `batchData_congr`: the clauses of
  `RamDriverCluster.TurnPre` and the descent's data, carried across a
  pass off the frame rule's equations.

# The surface repairs, and what is left

`RamDriverCluster.EnumStep` and `RamDriverCluster.ColourStep` are
**proved** (`enumStep`, `colourStep`). `DescendStep` is still open, and
what is left of it is symbolic execution again — see "What the batch
phase now owes" below.

The clauses the two obligations used to be short of, and where each
went:

1. **Indicator cells are bits.** `BatchData` carries
   `∀ k < n, Xa k ≤ 1` at `cluName j` — which is what
   `clusterLoad_spec` proves and what `oldCom`'s product needs, since
   the obligation's own postcondition says the product is a bit — and
   `∀ k < n, Wa k < B` at `batName j`, beside the ones `resName j`
   already had. `RamDriver.LevelPre` carries
   `∀ c < sigL cap mb j, ∀ z < n, C c z ≤ 1` for the colour arrays
   `oldCom` multiplies, which is `ColourStep`'s own postcondition one
   depth down and the empty palette at the root. And
   `RamDriverCluster.CoverHeld` carries `∀ z < n, ord z < n`, which with
   `n < B` is what `descendCom`'s first read of the ordering needs.
2. **The per-cluster arrays exist.** `RamDriver.DepthMem`, a conjunct of
   `LevelPre`, sizes every per-depth array of *every* depth — the
   cluster indicator, the restricted mask, the ball's two halves, the
   batch, the ordering, the cover's three copies, and the colour family
   `colName j c` for `c < sigL cap mb j`. It is depth-independent for
   the reason `RamDriver.TablesSized` is: a level runs the level below
   it, which stores into the arrays of *its* depth.
3. **The recorded play is in the state.** `RamDriver.PlayRec` is the
   invariant: the connectors `ctrName a` and the game masks `gamName a`
   of every `a < j` are there, hold vertices and words, and — off the
   dead branch — *are* the rounds of a `ReachedR` play whose position is
   the depth's own game arena. `RamDriver.playRec_succ` is the descent
   step and `RamDriver.playOk_of_playRec` the bridge to the old
   invariant. `DescendStep`'s last clause is now `PlayRec` one depth
   down, and `EnumStep`/`ColourStep` carry it across.
4. **The unreachable ancestor is guarded.** `RamDriver.ancestorStep`
   runs the search and the walk back separately, the second only under
   `dist[tv] < 2·cap + 1`. The recorded game's walk clause is guarded by
   the same condition — a round owes a walk to an earlier connector only
   where its own arena puts the two within `2·cap` — so the skip branch
   owes nothing at all, and what discharges it is
   `RamBfs.BfsTree.reach` read backwards: a sentinel distance is a proof
   of `¬ WithinDist`.
5. **`mb < B`** is the second conjunct of `RamDriver.WordBoundK`, and
   `enumStepW` reads it off `WordBoundK.mb_lt`.
6. **The graph is a hypothesis of `ColourStep`.** The three slot
   families are expansion chains and read the block structure, so the
   obligation is prefixed by `CsrGraph G ns O T` and `WordBoundK`,
   exactly as `DescendStep` is.

# What the batch phase now owes

The obstruction this file used to record was at the *surface*. The game
`RamDriver.playRec_succ` descended in was parameterized by an oracle: a
round isolated the oracle's batch, a **function** of the arena and the
two vertices, and the game's step rule extended a play to that function's
value and to no subgraph of it. The machine cannot produce
it. `RamBfsPaths.bfsPath_spec` pins the extraction buffer only as

    ∃ p, p.length ≤ d ∧ bufSet n L Buf = {z | z ∈ p.support}

— *some* walk of length at most the cap — and no function of `(A, u, v)`
is extractable from that. The sharp instance is `C₄` at `cap ≥ 1`: the
two antipodal vertices are joined by two walks of length two, the
machine picks by the order of the block structure's rows and
`SplitterWin.pathSet` picks by `Classical.choice`, and the two choices
are independent. Weakening the game to a containment did not help
either, since the program's buffer contains the oracle's chosen walk no
more than it equals it.

`Lax3Proofs.SplitterWinRec` is the repair, and it is on the game side:
the round **records** the set it isolated, and is asked only for what
the win argument consumes and what `bfsPath_spec` certifies. So the
batch phase owes, of the set `W` the batch indicator marks:

* `W ⊆ ball (masked G Gm) (2·cap) v` — the `andCom` with the ball at the
  end of `RamDriver.batchCom`;
* `v ∈ W` — the store of `1` at `ctrName j` at its start;
* for every round the state records, `RamDriver.RecordedRound`, whose
  arena puts its connector within `2·cap` of `v`: the support of *some*
  walk of length at most `2·cap` between them in that arena, intersected
  with the ball, lies in `W` — one turn of the fold, in the branch the
  guard takes;
* `(W ∩ X).Nonempty` and `W.ncard ≤ mb` — the connector, which is the
  centre `clusterLoad` materialized the cluster of and so lies in it
  (`RamCover.self_mem_wreach`, wave R1.8-T3-flip (c2a)), and one buffer
  of at most `2·cap + 1` vertices per earlier round;
* and the mask equations, which are `RamDriver.masked_step` and
  `masked_mul` as before, with `RamDriver.stepArena_le_nextArena` for the
  inequality between the two.

The size bound is the one clause that needs something from outside the
turn: `1 + j · (2·cap + 1) ≤ mb` holds because `mb = ℓ · (2·cap + 1)` and
`j < ℓ`, and neither is a clause of `RamDriverCluster.DescendStep`.
Neither has to be: they are hypotheses of the *theorem* discharging it,
in the manner of `RamDriverCluster.clusterStepImplements`'s `hcap`, and
the assembly wave has both where it applies that theorem —
`RamDriverCluster.levelImplements` quantifies its cluster-step hypothesis
over `j < ℓ`, and `mb`'s value is the driver's standing choice.

None of the rest is an equation with a set the program did not compute,
so all of it is symbolic execution over `RamBfsPaths.bfsPar_spec`,
`extractPath_spec` and the flat passes around them. `andSelfCom_spec`
below is the last of those; the engines are untouched.

# One more gap, in the kit — closed

`descendCom`'s last pass is
`subCom (gamName (j + 1)) (batName j) (gamName (j + 1))` — the source
and the destination are the **same array**. The pass is correct (a flat
pass writes cell `i` from cell `i` of everything it reads, so no cell is
read after it is written), but `RamDriverCluster.subCom_spec` asks
`a ≠ dst`, because `RamDriverCluster.fill_spec` carries its readers as a
`Frozen` family — an equation about the *whole* array, false of the
destination halfway through the loop — that the pass may not write. So
the obligation had no proof at the kit it was stated over, and it is not
the batch phase's gap: it survives every repair of that one.

`selfFill_spec` and `subSelfCom_spec` are the kit's in-place flat pass
and the mask operation the last line needs, with the destination's
*entering* cell function carried by the invariant (`SelfBelow`) instead
of frozen. No program change is needed.

/-! ### Reading a mask cell

A pass that reads a mask reads a *cell of a list*, and the bounded
semantics asks two things of such a read: that the index is inside the
list, and that the value it finds is a word. The first is the array's
length and the second is a clause about its contents — `MaskWords`
below — which no equation of the form `σ.arrs a = arrOf n Wa` implies
and which every pass that reads an indicator therefore has to be
handed. -/

/-! ### Carrying a depth's state across a pass

A pass of the driver writes a handful of arrays and a handful of
scalars, and everything else a depth is holding has to come back. The
frame rule reads off the syntax *which* names are safe; what it does
not do is put the depth's clauses back together out of them, and these
three lemmas are that — one per clause of `RamDriverCluster.TurnPre`
and one for the descent's own data. Each asks exactly for the names its
clause mentions, so a pass discharges it with one frame equation per
line and nothing is decided twice.

The memory clauses (`RamDriver.LevelMem`, the `Sized` list of
`RamDriver.OrderMem`) are not framed at all: a run cannot change the
length of an array, so they cross any pass by `RamDriver.Sized.run`. -/

/-! ### The batch, enumerated

`RamDriver.enumBatch` is two loops over one buffer: the first collects
the marked vertices in vertex order, the second repeats the first entry
to the fixed width `mb`. What the first loop owes is that its counter
never leaves the buffer, and that is a *counting* statement — the
entries written so far are distinct marked vertices, so there are at
most `mb` of them. `markedBelow` is the set they are, and the three
lemmas below are its arithmetic. -/

/-! ### The obligation

`RamDriverCluster.EnumStep` is the padding pass at the surface the
cluster step consumes it at. Its precondition is missing one clause —
that the batch indicator holds *words* — without which the pass's very
first read, `bat[z]`, has no value in the bounded semantics and the
`Spec` is not provable at all: `RamDriverCluster.BatchData` pins what
the array marks (`markSet n Wa = W`) and never what its cells are. The
clause is `MaskWords B (batName j)`, it is what the descent that writes
the array leaves behind, and it survives every pass by
`MaskWords.run`; `EnumStepW` is the obligation with it, and
`enumStep_of_maskWords` turns the one into the other. -/

/-! ### One step of neighbourhood expansion, walked

`RamDriver.expandCom` is the pass both chains of a cluster are built
from — the ball of the round in the descent, the three slot families in
the colouring — and it is the one pass of the driver with a loop inside
a loop. `RamDriverCluster` carries its mathematics and both of its
invariants; what is walked here is the symbolic execution between them:
the inner scan against `Csr.rowScan_spec` with `ScanHit`, the outer pass
against `Refine.SigmaLoop.forRangeZeroSum` with `ExpandInv`, and
`hit_eq_expandVal` at
the join. -/

/-! ### The chain

`RamDriver.chainCom` is `expandCom` iterated, and its walk is an
induction whose step is the equation below: the chain of `r + 1`
expansions is one pass into the first scratch name followed by the
chain of `r` at the shifted family. The ball's chain alternates between
two names (`RamDriver.ballStage`) and the colour chains run through
distinct ones; both are instances of the same recursion, which is why
the family is a parameter. -/

A chain that starts at a **bit** array ends at one — one expansion writes
either `1` or the source's own cell — which is what the driver's mask
products need of the ball: `RamDriver.descendCom`'s
`andCom (gamName j) (balName j) (gamName (j + 1))` multiplies the game
mask by the ball, and a ball whose cells were merely words would put that
product above the word bound and leave the pass with no run at all. -/

/-! ### The colour arrays of the next depth, addressed

`RamDriver.colourCom` writes one array per slot of the depth-`(j+1)`
palette, and every one of the three families addresses it by the
*numeric value* of the slot. So the first thing a walk over the phase
owes is that those numbers are pairwise distinct — a pass that wrote a
slot has to still hold it when the phase ends — and that is the
arithmetic of `Evaluator.slotOld`, `slotPd` and `slotPu`: the palette is
`Fin.castAdd`, `Fin.natAdd ∘ Fin.castAdd` and `Fin.natAdd ∘ Fin.natAdd`
of three blocks, so the three families occupy three intervals and each
is injective inside its own. -/

/-! ### The chain, stage by stage

`chainCom_spec` above says what the *last* name of a chain holds, which
is all the ball of the descent needs: its family alternates between two
arrays, so nothing else survives. The colouring's three chains run
through pairwise distinct names, and every stage of them is a slot of
the palette — so what the colouring needs is that all of them are still
there when the chain ends, and that they are bits. -/

/-! ### A fold of independent passes

Each of the colouring's three families is a fold of one pass per member,
and the members write disjoint sets of arrays: what one wrote is still
there when the fold ends. This is that argument once, over any list —
`RamDriver.foldRange` is the fold over `List.range` and the batch
profiles fold over `List.finRange`, and both are instances. -/

section Fold

/-- **A fold of passes that do not interfere.** Every member preserves
the phase's invariant `I` and leaves its own conclusion `R x`; a member
writes only arrays its own `Wr x` admits, and `R x` speaks only about
those. So the fold leaves every member's conclusion at once. -/

/-! ### The colouring of the next depth

`RamDriver.colourCom` is three folds — one per slot family of
`Lax3Proofs.FormulaTables` — and every member of every fold writes one
array of the depth-`(j+1)` palette and reads only what `ColPre` names.
So the phase is `foldr_family_spec` three times, at the three bodies
`RamDriverCluster.andCom_spec`/`copyCom_spec`, `fillCom_spec` followed
by a store followed by `chainCom_stages`, and `copyCom_spec` followed by
`chainCom_stages`. -/

/-! #### The obligation

The phase's *first* pass needs the cluster indicator to hold **bits**:
`oldCom` multiplies the depth's colour by it and the product has to be a
bit, which is what the obligation's own postcondition says. Wave D1
repaired `RamDriverCluster.BatchData` to carry exactly that — the
indicator's cells are `≤ 1` and not merely words — so the walk below
discharges the obligation directly, with no scaffold in between; and
`RamDriver.LevelPre`'s repaired colour clause supplies the depth's own
palette in the same form, so that too comes off the precondition rather
than out of a theorem hypothesis.

The counterexample the repair answers is the one wave C recorded: with a
cluster cell of value `2` the product `C c z * Xa z` is `2` at a marked
vertex of a coloured class, the postcondition's bit clause is refuted,
and with cells at the word bound the run itself vanishes. -/

/-! ### The cluster, materialized

`RamDriver.clusterLoad` opens the cluster indicator and marks the block
of the current centre: a flat fill, the two offset reads of the cluster
arena, and one scan of the block. What it leaves is the fibre
`RamCover.CoverOut.block` names — and, since every cell it writes is a
literal, an indicator whose cells are *bits*, which is the clause
`RamDriverCluster.ColourStep` is short of. -/

are words because the pass's exit pointer is (`hmB`). Under `WordBound`
that came off the carrier ceiling `n * n < B`; `hm` — the arena's
**length**, which the offsets index — is a separate clause and is

/-! ### The child's member list (rebase E-mem)

`clusterLoad` emitted the *block row* — the parent cluster's member
list, in the row's own order, `"bq"` cells of it. The child's list is
that row filtered by the child's own mask and compacted in place, which
is `RamDriver.memFilterCom`. The pass walks `"bq"` cells, never the
carrier, and it is *stable*, so the child list inherits the row's order:
sortedness is a supply chain whose first link is
`RamCover.CoverOut.block_mono`, and whose refutation, if that link ever
breaks, is `Refine.MemThreadProbe.unsorted_emission_refuted`.

The while is `Csr.scan "mk" "bq"`, so `Csr.rowScan_spec` carries it; the
only content is the invariant below. -/

/-- What the filter's scan carries: the read pointer inside the block,
the write pointer behind it, the raw list still untouched above the read
pointer — and the emitted prefix, sound, complete and strictly
increasing against the part of the raw list already read. -/
def MemFilt (n j bs : ℕ) (Mm A : ℕ → ℕ) (σ : Env) : Prop :=
  σ.vars "bq" = bs ∧ σ.vars "mk" ≤ bs ∧ σ.vars (mnumName j) ≤ σ.vars "mk" ∧
    σ.arrs (alvName j) = arrOf n A ∧
    ∃ g, σ.arrs (memName j) = arrOf n g ∧
      (∀ i, σ.vars "mk" ≤ i → i < n → g i = Mm i) ∧
      (∀ q, q < σ.vars (mnumName j) → ∃ p, p < σ.vars "mk" ∧ g q = Mm p ∧ A (Mm p) ≠ 0) ∧
      (∀ p, p < σ.vars "mk" → A (Mm p) ≠ 0 → ∃ q, q < σ.vars (mnumName j) ∧ g q = Mm p) ∧
      (∀ q₁ q₂, q₁ < q₂ → q₂ < σ.vars (mnumName j) → g q₁ < g q₂)

/-- **The filter pass, discharged.** From a raw list of `bs` cells that
is repetition-free and increasing and contains every vertex the mask
`A` marks, the pass leaves a `MemEnum` of `A` in the live prefix.

The completeness hypothesis `hcov` is where "the child is inside the
block" is spent: `RamDriverCluster.DescendStep`'s own clause says the
next depth's mask marks only cluster members, and `clusterLoad_spec`
says the raw list is exactly the cluster.

**The cost is charged at the block**, not at the carrier: `23·bs + 8`,
the two-counter head's `4 + 4` plus `19 + 4` per block cell — the taken
branch's store and bump, plus the scan's own test. The probe's measured
`21·bs + 8` (`Refine.MemThreadProbe.filterClock`) is the clock of one
particular block, two of whose three members survive the filter; `23` is
the uniform per-cell bound the walk can carry, and the two agree on the
all-alive block. -/

/-! ### A flat pass that reads its own destination

`RamDriver.descendCom`'s last pass is
`subCom (gamName (j + 1)) (batName j) (gamName (j + 1))`: the source and
the destination are the same array. The pass is correct — a flat pass
writes cell `i` from cell `i` of everything it reads, so no cell is read
after it is written — but `RamDriverCluster.fill_spec` cannot see that.
Its readers are a `RamDriverCluster.Frozen` family, which is an equation
about the *whole* array and is false of the destination halfway through
the loop, and `subCom_spec` therefore asks `a ≠ dst`.

The repair is one invariant: below the counter the array holds the new
value, at and above it the old one. `SelfBelow` is that invariant,
`selfFill_spec` the pass, and `subSelfCom_spec` the mask operation the
driver's last pass is. The old value is a *parameter*, so the cell
expression may read it, which is exactly what the aliasing pass needs
and what `Frozen` cannot express.

Nothing else in the driver aliases, so this is stated once and used
once. -/

/-! ### The scalars the descent moves

The array side of the descent's frame is
`RamDriverFrames.underscore_notMem_warrs_descendCom`; this is the scalar
side. Every scalar `descendCom` assigns is either the depth's own
connector — which the descent is *supposed* to move — or one of the
nineteen counters below, none of which is a prefixed name and none of
which any clause of a depth's state speaks about. The search's own
scalars are the fiddly part, and they are read off `bfsParCom`'s syntax
once: the radius is a construction-time constant, so `bfsParCom r`'s
scalar set does not depend on it, and neither does `ancestorStep`'s on
the round it is taken at. -/

`cur`/`pl`/`plen`. -/

/-! ### Marking a path buffer

`RamDriver.markPath` is the one loop of the descent that writes through
an *indirection*: the cell it stores into is named by the buffer the
extraction pass filled, not by the counter. So what it owes is one range

leaves is the union of what the indicator marked with the set the buffer
names. -/

/-! ### One earlier round

`RamDriver.ancestorStep` copies the round's own game mask into the
search's arena, searches from the round's connector, and — under the
guard — walks the parents back and marks them. What the recorded game
asks of the turn is a walk *in that round's arena*, which is why the
copy is of `gamName a` and not of the depth's own mask, and the guard's
false branch owes nothing at all: a sentinel distance is a proof of
`¬ WithinDist`, which is the very hypothesis the game's walk clause is
guarded by. -/

/-! ### The batch of the round

`RamDriver.batchCom` opens the indicator, stores the connector, folds one
`RamDriver.ancestorStep` over every earlier round, and cuts the result
down to the ball. The fold is *accumulating* — every turn writes the same
array — so it is not an instance of `foldr_family_spec`; what carries it
is the invariant below, which is exactly the four things
`RamDriver.playRec_succ` asks of the batch, at the rounds taken so far.

The invariant was falsified before it was proved, on the four instances
its clauses are sharp at: a round whose search fails (the size clause has
to hold with `∅` added), a round whose walk leaves the ball (the walk
clause has to be stated *intersected* with the ball, which is why the
last pass is the `andCom` and not a plain copy), the empty fold (the
connector alone, `1 + 0 · (2·cap + 1)`), and the full fold at `j = ℓ`
(`1 + ℓ · (2·cap + 1) ≤ mb` fails by one unless `mb = ℓ · (2·cap + 1)`
is read with `j < ℓ`, which is why both are hypotheses of the theorem
and not clauses of the obligation). -/

/-! ### What the descent writes

The array side of the descent's frame, sharpened from
`RamDriverFrames.underscore_notMem_warrs_descendCom` — which separates
the prefixed names from the colours and the tables — to the twelve names
the pass actually writes. The two masks of the *next* depth are among
them, so the frame has to tell `alvName j` from `alvName (j + 1)`, which
is the one place in the driver where a name's depth has to be read back
off the name. -/

/-! ### The descent, discharged

The nine passes composed. Six of them are flat and their content is the
two mask equations `RamDriver.masked_step` and `RamDriver.masked_mul`;
the seventh is the expansion chain the ball is built by, the eighth the
batch phase above, and the ninth the in-place difference
`subSelfCom_spec` was written for.

Two facts come from *outside* the turn and are hypotheses of the theorem
rather than clauses of `RamDriverCluster.DescendStep`, in the manner of
`RamDriverCluster.clusterStepImplements`'s `hcap`: that `mb` is
`ℓ · (2·cap + 1)` and that the depth is below `ℓ`. Together they give
`1 + j · (2·cap + 1) ≤ mb`, the size bound on the batch, and
`RamDriverCluster.levelImplements` has both where it applies the
obligation. -/
