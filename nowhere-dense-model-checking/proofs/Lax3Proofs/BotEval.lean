/-!
The **edgeless base case** of the model-checking recursion: satisfaction
of distance logic in the graph `⊥` on `Fin n`, the arena at which the
descent through the splitter game tree stops and returns `Sat` itself.
An implementation has to *evaluate* that value, by color lookups and
counting; the lemmas below are the bridge it evaluates along.

An edgeless graph has no walks but the empty ones, so every distance in
it is zero or infinite. Two vertices are within distance `d` exactly when
they are equal, at every radius, and the distance from a vertex to a
color class is smaller than `r` exactly when the vertex itself carries
the color and `r` is positive. All five atoms therefore reduce to two
questions about the environment — which of its entries are equal, and
which colors each entry carries — and those same two questions decide
every formula, because neither quantifier can reach anything else:

* a *local* quantifier collapses to a finite disjunction over its guard
  set, `sat_exL_bot`, since the only vertex within any radius of `m i`
  is `m i` itself. A local formula is thus decided by reading the rows
  of the entries already in scope, with no search over the vertex set at
  all — which is why a local sentence, whose guard set is empty, is
  simply false, and why the evaluator's scatter atoms are the only place
  a search survives;
* an *unrestricted* quantifier does range over all of `Fin n`, but it
  sees a witness only through the witness's *row* — the colors it
  carries — and through the witness's equalities with the tuple already
  in scope. Two vertices with equal rows that both lie off the tuple are
  therefore interchangeable as witnesses, `sat_exU_bot_swap`, so a
  witness search need only try the entries of the tuple and one
  representative of each row realized off it: `sat_exU_bot_of_repr`.
  There are at most `2 ^ L` rows, `ncard_le_of_injOn_rowOf`, so the
  search runs over at most `k + 2 ^ L` candidates however large `n` is.
  That is the sense in which the base case is finite.

# The permutation trick

Interchangeability of equal-row witnesses is *not* proved by an
induction carrying a hypothesis that two environments have matching rows
and matching equality patterns. That induction does not close: at an
unrestricted quantifier it must turn a witness for the first environment
into a witness for the second, and a vertex off the second tuple with
the prescribed row need not exist — over `Fin 2` and `Fin 1` with no
colors the two one-element environments match, and `∃ y, y ≠ x` separates
them.

What does close is moving the whole structure rather than the
environment. A permutation of the vertices preserving every color class
is an automorphism of an edgeless colored graph, so it preserves
satisfaction outright: `sat_perm_bot`, the diagonal case of the transport
`sat_congr_bot_of_bij` along a color-preserving bijection between two
vertex sets. The transposition of two off-tuple vertices of equal rows is
such a permutation, and it fixes the tuple pointwise, so only the witness
moves — which is exactly `sat_exU_bot_swap`.

# Formalization notes

Nothing here hands a concept-side definition to a tactic. `Sat` and
`WithinDist` are taken apart through the clause lemmas of
`Lax3Proofs.SyntaxLemmas` and through the atom lemmas of this file, which
are their edgeless specializations; `rowOf`, introduced here, is unfolded
freely.

`withinDist_bot` and `exists_walk_bot_lt` are stated for an arbitrary
vertex type, as the walk-distance lemmas of `Lax3Proofs.WalkDistance`
are; everything about `Sat` is tied to `Fin n`, as `Sat` itself is.

The row of a vertex is a `Set (Fin L)`, matching the `Set`-valued color
classes of `Lax3.ColoredGraphs`; row equality and the pointwise
color-agreement the transfer lemmas ask for are the same statement, and
`rowOf_eq_iff` is the translation.

/-! ### Walks in an edgeless graph

The only walks of `⊥` are the empty ones: a `cons` would carry an edge.
Both facts below are that observation, read off at the two shapes the
distance atoms of the logic use — a non-strict bound between two
vertices, and a strict bound to a color class.

/-! ### The atoms

The five atoms of the logic on an edgeless arena. Adjacency is never
satisfied, both distance atoms degenerate into their radius-zero
readings, and equality and color atoms are what they always are: the
whole table is a question about the equalities and the colors of the
environment's entries.

/-! ### The collapse of local quantification -/

section Local

variable {L n k : ℕ} {col : Coloring n L} {m : Fin k → Fin n}

/-- **A local quantifier over an edgeless arena is a finite disjunction
over its guard set.** The guard asks for a vertex within radius `r` of
some `m i`, and on an edgeless arena the only such vertex is `m i`, so
the quantifier ranges over the entries of the environment named by the
guard set and over nothing else. Several guard variables may name the
same vertex; the disjunction then merely repeats a disjunct, which is
why the equivalence needs no injectivity side condition.

In particular a local *sentence* is decided outright, its guard set
being a `Finset (Fin 0)`. -/

/-! ### Transporting satisfaction along a color-preserving bijection

An edgeless colored graph is a pure unary structure, so any bijection of
its vertices matching the color classes is an isomorphism of it, and
satisfaction travels along. The induction is the trivial one: the two
distance atoms have already become equality tests, and both quantifiers
push their witness through the bijection.
