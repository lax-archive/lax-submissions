The combinatorial core of the locality theorem (arXiv:2606.23180, Lem.
`scatter`): a scatter count decides whether a vertex set `X` reaches
beyond the `r`-neighborhood of a tuple.

Fix a tuple `a` of vertices, a cluster system for it at radius `r`
(`Lax3Proofs.Clusters`) with radius `R`, and a set `X`. Let `S` be an
inclusion-wise maximal `4R`-scattered subset of `X` — the object a
scatter sentence measures the size of. Then

  `X` has a vertex farther than `r` from the tuple

holds exactly when

  `X` has a vertex at distance more than `r` and at most `H` from the
  tuple, or fewer than `|S|` clusters meet `X`.

The point of the equivalence is that both alternatives on the right are
*local* to the tuple: the first is a statement inside the ball of radius
`H`, the second is a count of clusters, which a scatter sentence
supplies. The left-hand side, by contrast, quantifies over the whole
graph. This is the step at which the locality proof discharges a
quantifier that ranges arbitrarily far away.

The proof is the source's. Either some vertex of `X` sits in the margin
`r < dist(x, a) ≤ 4R + r`, and then both sides hold outright, or no
vertex does, and then every vertex of `X` within `4R + r` of the tuple
is already within `r` of it. Under that margin condition each cluster
meeting `X` contains exactly one vertex of `S`: maximality of `S` puts
some `s ∈ S` within `4R` of the cluster, the margin puts `s` inside the
`r`-neighborhood hence inside some cluster, pairwise farness of clusters
puts it inside *this* cluster, and the `2R` bound on cluster diameter
forbids a second one. So the cluster count equals `|S ∩ N_r(a)|`, and
the equivalence becomes `|S ∩ N_r(a)| < |S|`, i.e. `S ⊄ N_r(a)`, which
is the left-hand side: a vertex of `S` outside `N_r(a)` is a witness,
and conversely a witness `x` outside `N_{4R+r}(a)` could be added to `S`
were all of `S` inside `N_r(a)`, contradicting maximality.

# Formalization notes

The number of clusters meeting `X` is `Set.ncard` of the set of
surviving indices whose cluster meets `X`, rather than a `Finset.card`;
the set is a subset of the finite index set `C.I`, and `Set.ncard`
avoids carrying decidability instances for the intersection condition.
The counting step is an explicit bijection — index ↦ its unique vertex
of `S` — and `Set.InjOn.ncard_image`.

`Maximal (fun T => T ⊆ X ∧ DistIndependent G (4 * C.R) T) S` is the
hypothesis shape of `Lax3.ScatterSentences.ScatterChoice.spec`, so a
scatter value can be handed to this lemma exactly as the choice
produces it. Finiteness of `S` is a hypothesis rather than a consequence
because the statement is over an arbitrary vertex type; over `Fin n`,
where the model checking theorem lives, it is automatic.

/-- The core lemma: with `S` an inclusion-wise maximal `4R`-scattered
subset of `X` and `H ≥ 4R + r`, the set `X` reaches beyond the
`r`-neighborhood of the tuple `a` exactly when it does so already within
distance `H`, or fewer than `|S|` clusters of the system meet `X`. This
is Lem. `scatter` of the source. -/
