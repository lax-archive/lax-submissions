**The end of the RAM chain**: `RamDriver.driverRoot`, at `R = 0`,
decides the sentence in the graph its input word encodes.

`driverRoot_decides_sentence` is `RamDriver.driver_correct` with every
obligation instantiated. What is left of the hypotheses is exactly three
kinds of thing.

* **The input word.** `Lax11.GraphEncoding.EncodesGraph`, the slot count,
  the two arrays it decodes into — and `RamElim.CsrSimple`, the clause
  wave D4 established as *data of the word*: the encoding deliberately
  permits a block to name a vertex twice, and the two eliminations of the
  ordering phase read a degree off a row, so "no block names a vertex
  twice" is produced at the root and threaded down.
* **The parameters.** `q_top` above the sentence's rank, `cap` the
  locality radius `rhoMinus 0 q_top`, `mb = ℓ·(2·cap+1)` the padded batch
  width, `ℓ = N (2s+2)` the round budget, the word bound, and the value
  bounds the base pass and the scatter atoms form.

  **The word bound is `RamDriver.WordBoundK` at `Kmass`** (rebase E-mem,
  leaf W3), not the carrier bound `RamDriver.WordBound`: the cluster
  arena's pointer ceiling is read at the cover-degree parameter this
  theorem's own `hdeg` slot bounds, so the arena clause is
  `n·Kmass + n + ns + 2·cap + 2 < B` instead of `n² + ns + 2·cap + 2 < B`.
  No new parameter enters — `Kmass` is `hdeg`'s — and no conclusion
  moves; the two addresses into the arena that used to come off
  `WordBound.cover` are supplied by the mass readings
  `Refine.ArenaPointer.ptrWords_of_mass` / `massWords_of_mass` at the
  ordering the cover phase produced. What it buys is the bridge:
  `Refine.BridgeSeamProbe.no_word_size_for_sparse` refuted the carrier
  bound against `Compile.Layout.FitsWords` at word lengths C0's own
  domain admits, and `Refine.BridgeCrossing` compiles that the same
  argument at this slot is false.
* **The mathematics of the campaign.** `hQ`, uniform quasi-wideness of
  the arena at radius `2·cap` — the one hypothesis that is not about the
  machine at all — together with the cost side conditions, which are
  inequalities between free cost parameters and the landed costs of the
  phases.

No obligation `Prop` is a hypothesis. The chain, bottom up:

| slot | filled by |
|------|-----------|
| `ElimAvail` | `RamElim.implements` |
| `AugAvail` | `RamDriverAugment.implements` |
| `CoverAvail` | `RamDriverOrder.coverTurnImplements` |
| `DescendStep` | `RamDriverDescend.descendStep` |
| `EnumStep` | `RamDriverDescend.enumStep` |
| `ColourStep` | `RamDriverDescend.colourStep` |
| `InnerFrames` | `RamDriverFrames.innerFrames`, on this file's write sets |
| `ScatterStep` | `Refine.ScatterDeadTurn.scatterDeadStep` |
| `ReadbackStep` | `RamDriverBase.readbackStep` |
| `KillListStep` | `killListStep` below, on `Refine.KillListWalk` |
| `ClusterStepImplements` | `RamDriverCluster.clusterStepImplements` |
| `ClusterFrames` | `RamDriverFrames.clusterFrames` |
| `OrderImplements` | `RamDriverCompose.orderImplements₀` (at `R = 0`) |
| `CoverImplements` | `RamDriverCompose.coverImplements` |
| `BaseImplementsD` | `RamDriverCompose.baseImplementsD` |
| `LevelImplements` | `RamDriverCluster.levelImplements` |
| `DecodeImplements` | `RamDriverIO.decodeImplements` |
| `SentenceImplements` | `RamDriverIO.sentenceImplements` |

**Why `R = 0`.** The ordering phase is discharged there and nowhere else:
`RamDriverCompose.orderImplements₀`'s docstring records that at `R > 0`
the two `tgt` couplings of `RamAugment.AugPre` are still open. The
augmentation round *itself* is proved — `RamDriverAugment.implements` is
`AugAvail` here — so what `R > 0` costs is a coupling and not a walk.

**The two data hypotheses, and their producers** (rebase F-c-3). Of the
hypotheses above that are neither input-word data, parameter equations
nor cost side conditions, exactly two were bare — carried because
nothing produced them:

| slot | producer |
|------|----------|
| `hbinj` | `blockInj_slot`, off `RamCover.CoverOut.block_inj` (B3) |
| `hdeg` | `wreachDeg_of_orderP`, off the phase's `P` slot at `R = R*` |

The first is closed here (`driverRoot_decides_sentence_binj`). The
second is closed *modulo one obligation*: the step from the slot to the
coefficient is proved, the threading through
`RamDriverCluster.levelImplements` is done, and what is left is the
`R > 0` phase walk `RamDriverCompose.OrderImplementsR`. See the two
sections below.

/-! ### The frame of the nested call, at the driver

`RamDriverFrames.innerFrames` asks four syntactic things of the nested
program. At `RamDriver.driverAt … (j+1)` each of them is
`Lax3Proofs.RamDriverWrites`' reading of the recursion: everything the
enclosing turn is holding is a name of a depth at or below `j`, and a
level at depth `j + 1` writes only depths `j + 1` and above. -/

/-! ### The kill list, at the surface the turn consumes it at

**Wave R1.8-T3-flip (a2).** `Refine.KillListWalk` is the walk;
`RamDriverCluster.KillListStep` is the surface, and this is the step
between them. There is no mathematics: the pass writes one array — the
depth's own kill list, a name no clause of a turn is about — and five
scalars, so every "unchanged" conjunct of the postcondition is one frame
lemma off `RamDriverWrites.warrs_killListCom` / `wvars_killListCom`, and
the one new conjunct is the walk's own enumeration re-read at the turn's
`X` and `W`.

That re-reading is the only thing worth naming. The walk's guard is the
two cells `alv[v]·clu[v]` at a *buffer entry*, and `KillListAt` speaks
about the set `{v | M v ≠ 0 ∧ v ∈ X ∧ v ∈ W}` — which is exactly
`RamDriverCluster.KillRowsAt`'s domain. The two are the same set because
`ClusterData` says the buffer's range is the batch's cluster half
(`Set.range w = W ∩ X`, wave R1.8-T3-flip (c2a)) and the cluster array
marks the cluster (`markSet n Xa = X`); that is where the turn's data
enters and nothing else does. The narrowing costs the re-reading
nothing: the guard already tests `clu[v]`, so the entries it drops are
exactly the ones the guard rejected. -/

section KillList

/-- **The kill pass leaves the padding buffer alone**, so the `ClusterWa`
seam runs one link further than it did in wave R1.8-T2: the kill pass
writes the child depth's tables and the evaluator's scratch, and `"wa"`
is neither. This is what makes the kill list the *fourth* consumer of the
seam, still strictly before the nested call. -/

/-! ### The ball budget of a turn, at its own block (wave B4-walk-1)

`Refine.ScatterDeadPass.ballBudget_carrier` grants every ball the whole
carrier — `(ns, n)` at the witness `Finset.range n` — because a
mask-specific witness could not be threaded through
`RamDriverCluster.clusterStepImplements` at all while `hbud` was
quantified over *every* mask. It no longer is: the step's `hbud` asks
only for masks supported inside the turn's cluster, which is exactly the
descent's own §5.3 clause, and at such a mask the natural witness is the
block the cover pass emitted for this centre.

The two numbers that come out are `Refine.MassWeight.blockRowSum` and
`Refine.MassMath.blockSize` — the two currencies of
`Refine.MassWeight.blockWeight`
(`Refine.B4Design.ball_budget_numbers_are_block_weight`), so the ball
term of the scatter charge is now read at the same block weight the
turn's descend leaves are read at. Neither number needs block
injectivity: an image is never larger, or heavier, than its source. -/

section BallBudget

variable {n : ℕ}

/-- **Every ball of a cluster-supported arena fits in the turn's own
block.** The witness is the block's member slots; `CoverOut.block` makes
them onto the cluster, and `hsub` puts the arena's live vertices there.
`BallBudget` asks for the ball's *live* vertices only, which is what
makes the cluster enough.

The two numbers are stated as the **minimum** of the block's reading and
the carrier's, because the one witness pays both at once: its slot
weight is under the block's `blockRowSum` (an image is no heavier than
its source) and under `ns` (distinct vertices tile the target array),
and its size is under `blockSize` and under `n`. So this lemma both
*narrows* the budget — `min ≤ blockRowSum ≤ blockWeight` — and keeps the
carrier bound the landed atom charge is still stated at, with no block
injectivity anywhere. -/

/-- The seven walks of a turn, at the costs their own files charge.

**Wave R1.8-T2.** The kill pass is the fourth, and its charge is absorbed
here — inside the turn's own slot, which is design §7's disposition F-4.
It is one of the two summands that mention neither `n` nor `ns`:
`Refine.KillPass.killCost` is `(blockCost + 21) · mb + 6`, carrier-blind,
read at the child depth's table because that is the row it writes.

**Wave R1.8-T3-flip (a2).** The kill list is the fifth, and its charge is
absorbed the same way and for the same reason:
`Refine.KillListPass.killListCost mb = (20·mb + 64)·mb + 8` is
carrier-blind too — `n` does not occur — and quadratic in the *formula*
sized `mb = ℓ·(2·cap+1)`, which is the design's accepted `O(mb²)` dedupe
class (§6 (a)). The absorption is **not** free at the old constant: the
probe's `ct = 284` was an exact fit, so `Refine.KillListPass.ctKL` moves
it by exactly the measured instance and
`Refine.KillListPass.killList_interface_closes` re-runs the Σ closure
there — the closure is indifferent to the turn coefficient's value,
which is F-4's disposition, so absorbing the list moves a number and no
interface. -/

before, which the size slot no longer permits. `hKl` is the level
condition in the Σ shape, which `levelCost_of_sigma` below produces from
`CostRecurrence.exists_driverCostsSigma`.

**Rebase B8.** `hmass` is **gone**: the mass mathematics is no longer
threaded as an opaque bundle but
*derived* from the two facts it actually needs — the cover's block
injectivity `hbinj` and the cover-degree bound `hdeg`.

**Rebase G2/E6.** The Σ interface reads the **arena weight**: the
conclusion is `Kl j (arenaWeight n G M)`, the induction's abstract
measures are instantiated at `MassWeight.arenaWeight n G` /
`MassWeight.blockWeight n G` (ONE fixed root graph through the whole
recursion — E5's constraint), the mass pair comes from
`MassWeight.mass_of_alive_compaction_weight` at the same `Kmass`
coefficient, and the descend clause is consumed as
`MassWeight.arenaWeight_le_blockWeight`. The hypothesis LIST is
byte-identical to B8's — `∀ j m`-shaped side conditions are
form-invariant under the re-read; what changed is the point they are
READ at, and the four phase slots' honest forms are still the
carrier-charged ones (the per-slot gap ledger is compiled in
`Refine.G2CostProbe` §7 — they move only when the block-driven engines
land).

**Rebase E-mem/W3.** `hB` is `RamDriver.WordBoundK` at `Kmass` — the
degree parameter `hdeg` already bounds — and goes down to every phase
unchanged; the induction is uniform in it. The cover phase's two arena
slots, which are the only readings the carrier bound used to be needed
for, are the mass readings of `Refine.ArenaPointer` at the ordering the
loop produced, discharged from `hdeg` itself. The hypothesis list is
otherwise unchanged and the conclusion is untouched. -/

/-! ### The level condition, against the solver and against the old interface

Two arithmetic corollaries and no machine: the first says
`CostRecurrence.exists_driverCostsSigma` discharges `levelAt`'s `hKl`,
the second says instantiating the size slots constantly gives back the
interface the driver had before this wave. Together they are the claim
that the re-threading is a *refinement*: nothing downstream can have got
harder. -/

section Bridge

variable {ℓ D : ℕ}

/-- **The solver discharges the level condition.**
`CostRecurrence.exists_driverCostsSigma` produces its turn budget `Kt`
with the loop's per-turn overhead at `8`; the compacted centre loop of
`RamDriverCluster.levelImplements` pays `11`, because B3's loop header
reads the turn's position out of the compacted list before the turn
(`3`) on top of the guard and the bump. The gap is a constant three per
turn and it is absorbed **here**, in the thread, not in the solver:
`exists_driverCostsSigma` is applied with its `turn` slot at
`turnCostSize … + 3`, which makes `hshift` its own turn clause.

The solver stays canonical (B6's minimality), and the driver's interface
stays the one its loop actually produces.

The dead-sweep summand that used to be folded into the cover side is absent:
the sweep is no longer in the program, so the solver's native two-phase shape
is exactly the driver's shape. -/

every size slot as a constant turns the Σ-shaped level condition back
into the one `driverRoot_decides_sentence` took before this wave —
`(Ks j + 11) · n + 6` — so every consumer that could discharge the old
condition can discharge the new one, and the re-threading costs no
slack. `Refine.SigmaLoop.sum_const_eq_uniform` is the loop-side half of
the same statement.

This is what keeps B4, B5 and B7 unblocked while the remaining leaves
are still carrier-driven: they may supply constant size families and
lose nothing. The readback leaf already uses the local block-weight
slot. -/

/-! ### The plug, checked

B8's stale-corollary discipline: `levelCost_of_sigma` is an arithmetic
statement *about* `levelAt`'s `hKl` slot, and an arithmetic statement
compiles whether or not it still fits the slot. So the fit is written
down as a term — `levelAt_of_sigma` is `levelAt` with its level
condition supplied by the solver's shape, and it type-checks only if
the two shapes are still the same one. Re-run at rebase F-c-2, whose
only cost move is `RamDriverCompose.orderPhaseCost`'s constants and so
touches `hKo`, not this. -/

/-! ### The `hbinj` slot, discharged (rebase F-c-3)

B6 designed `Refine.MassMath.BlockInj` to be *projected* out of the
cover pass's exit relation once the pass carried the clause, and in the
meantime stated every mass lemma against it as a named hypothesis —
which is how it reached this file's `hbinj`, one of the two slots B7's
hypothesis table had no producer for. Wave B3 added the clause
(`RamCover.CoverInv.block_inj`, threaded through `CoverInv.step` on
strict monotonicity of the write pointer and read off by
`CoverInv.out`), and its statement came out identical to `BlockInj`'s
clause for clause, so the projection is one field access —
`Refine.MassMath.blockInj_of_coverOut`.

`blockInj_slot` is that projection *at the slot's type*, written out
rather than inlined: the type below is `levelAt`'s and
`driverRoot_decides_sentence`'s `hbinj` hypothesis verbatim, so
supplying it is a type-check and not an argument. This is B8's
stale-corollary discipline applied to a slot with no arithmetic in it —
a producer compiles whether or not it still fits, and
`driverRoot_decides_sentence_binj` below is where the fit is
*witnessed*. -/

end BlockInjSlot

/-! ### The `hdeg` slot, and where its producer has to come from (F-c-3)

`hdeg` is the other of B7's two producerless hypotheses, and it is
producerless for a *structural* reason, not for want of a wave: it asks
for the cover-degree coefficient at **every** permutation of the
carrier, and a cover's degree is a property of the ordering the phase
built. No theorem of the campaign proves it for an arbitrary `π`, and
none can — `CoverDegree.exists_cover_degree`'s conclusion is about the
ordering of a chain's last elimination.

The slot the fact belongs in is `RamDriver.OrderImplements`'s parametric
`P`, anchored by F-c and instantiated by
`RamDriverCompose.OrderP` at `R = R*`. Two things were needed to make
that reach the coefficient, and both are done:

* **the threading** — `RamDriverCluster.levelImplements` destructured
  the phase's `P` witness away one line after it arrived; its `hmass`
  slot now takes `P π ord` beside `RamCover.OrdersBy` (F-c-3). At
  `R = 0`, `P` is `True` and `levelAt` supplies it with `_`, so nothing
  above this file moved;
* **the step** — `wreachDeg_of_orderP` below, which is
  `CoverDegree.wreach_degree_of_data` read at the slot value.

What is left is the phase walk itself
(`RamDriverCompose.OrderImplementsR`, residual itemized there). Until it
lands, `hdeg` stays a hypothesis of `driverRoot_decides_sentence` — but
it is a hypothesis with a named producer waiting on one obligation,
rather than one nothing can discharge. -/

coefficient.** Handed a bound that holds of every `R`-round chain of the

consumes and `Refine.ArenaBlock.mass_of_alive_compaction` charges the
level's turns against. -/

/-- **The RAM driver decides the model-checking answer.**

Handed the tape encoding of a graph, `RamDriver.driverRoot` at `R = 0`
runs — inside the cost `Kdec + (Kl 0 n + Ksent)` — and writes `[1]` if
the first-order sentence `φ` holds in the graph and `[0]` if it does not.

Nothing about the machine is a hypothesis: every obligation of
`RamDriver.driver_correct`, of `RamDriverCluster.levelImplements` and of
the cluster step is instantiated by the walk that discharges it. What is
left is the input word's own data, the parameter equations, the campaign
mathematics `hQ`, and free cost parameters with their side conditions.

**Rebase B2 (§5.8), re-read at the weight (G2/E6).** The program, the
precondition and the postcondition are **byte-identical** to what they
were; the cost is `Kl 0 (n + ns)` because a level's budget is a
function of the **weight** of the arena it runs on and the root's mask
kills nothing (`Refine.MassWeight.arenaWeight_root`, which needs the
input word's `CsrSimple` — the clause G1's dedup produces at the C0
boundary). `hKs`/`hKl` are the §5.7/§5.6 shapes read at weights,
`hKmono` is new, and — rebase B8 — the mass bundle `hmass` has become
the two facts it is derived from (`hbinj`, `hdeg`). The obsolete
dead-row sweep and its cost slot are absent. The conclusion is untouched.

**Rebase E-mem/W3: the word-bound slot.** `hB` is
`RamDriver.WordBoundK B n Kmass ns cap mb`, the value bound with the
cluster arena's pointer ceiling read at `hdeg`'s own degree parameter,
in place of the carrier bound `RamDriver.WordBound`. It is the *only*
hypothesis that moved: the list, the order, the program, the
precondition, the postcondition and the cost are all what they were.
`hdeg` now does double duty — it bounds the cover's degree for the mass
recursion, as before, and it is what makes the arena's pointer a word
(`Refine.ArenaPointer.ptr_le_mass`). The bridge consequence is
`Refine.BridgeCrossing`: this slot has a value bound at every word of
C0's domain, at the layout's own constant, including at the instance
where `Refine.BridgeSeamProbe.no_word_size_for_sparse` kills the carrier
bound for every value bound. -/

/-- **The same, with `hbinj` supplied** (rebase F-c-3). The root
theorem minus the block-injectivity slot, which
`RamDriverRoot.blockInj_slot` fills out of `RamCover.CoverOut`'s own
field. Nothing else moves: the program, the precondition, the
postcondition and the cost are `driverRoot_decides_sentence`'s, and the
remaining hypotheses are the same list in the same order.

This is the plug check for that slot in B8's sense. A producer of the
right *reading* type-checks on its own; what says it is the reading the
driver still asks for is this application, and it would break the
moment either side drifted. -/
