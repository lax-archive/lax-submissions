/-!
Splitter's win in the isolation splitter game when the short walks his
strategy maintains are **recorded** rather than computed: the
program-facing form of `Lax3Proofs.SplitterWin`.

# Why this file exists

`Lax3Proofs.SplitterWin` fixes Splitter's strategy once and for all with
`pathSet`, a `Classical.choice` walk of length at most `r` between two
vertices of one arena. The model-checking program cannot make that
choice: it computes its own shortest paths, by breadth-first search in
the arena it currently holds, and the walk it ends up with is whatever
its search found.

Nor can the program's walk be *named* by a function of the arena and the
two vertices, which is what an oracle interface would ask for. What the
machine leaves behind is pinned by `Lax3Proofs.RamBfsPaths.bfsPath_spec`
only up to `∃ p, p.length ≤ d ∧ bufSet n L Buf = {z | z ∈ p.support}` —
*some* walk of length at most the cap. Two independent solutions of that
existential may differ: in `C₄` at `r ≥ 2` the two antipodal vertices are
joined by two walks of length two, and which one comes back is decided by
the order of the block structure's rows on one side and by
`Classical.choice` on the other. So a game whose move at a round is a
*function* of the position cannot be the game the program plays.

It does not have to be. No proof of `SplitterWin` ever looks at *which*
walk `pathSet` returned; the whole development is deduced from the facts
that the isolated set contains, for every earlier connector, the support
of a genuine walk of length at most `r` to the new one, and that it is
small. So the game below **records** the isolated set as data of the
round and constrains it by exactly those facts.

# The recorded round

A `RoundR` is Connector's vertex, the arena it was played in, and a set
of vertices `gen` — the vertices Splitter *meant* to isolate. The round
isolates `batchR`, the part of `gen` inside the ball the round restricts
to; `ReachedR.step` asks of `gen` only that

* it contains Connector's own vertex, and
* for every earlier round `e` whose arena puts its connector within `r`
  of the new one, it contains the support of *some* walk of length at
  most `r` between them in that arena.

The second clause is *guarded*: an earlier connector the round's arena
does not reach within `r` contributes nothing. That costs the win
argument nothing, since a connector that still carries an edge lies in
the ball of every earlier round (`mem_ball_of_roundR`), so the pairs the
extraction actually uses always satisfy the guard. It is what lets the
program skip the walk back when its search did not reach the target.

No size clause is imposed on a recorded round: `no_full_survivalR`, the
extraction the driver consumes, never looks at the size of a batch, and
imposing one would oblige the program to prove a bound it does not need
there. The size *is* what makes a recorded round a legal move of the
game, and that is where it appears — `splitterWins_of_reachedR` bounds
the batches of the rounds it plays itself, and its continuation is
`SplitterWin`'s own `pathSet` strategy, which is where the recorded game
and the chosen one meet.

# What is here

`ReachedR` and the invariants (`isolatedR`, `selfR`,
`mem_ball_of_roundR`, `picksR_nodup`, `reachedR_entry`, `pairR_walk`,
`pairR_disjoint`), `no_full_survivalR` and `splitterWins_of_reachedR`
line up one for one with `SplitterWin`'s originals and are proved the
same way, with the round's own `gen`, `batchR` and `nextArenaR` in place
of `genSet`, `batch` and `nextArena`. Everything generic is imported
rather than repeated: the walk helpers, the `Iff.rfl` lemmas opening the
concept-side definitions, `eq_of_mem_ball_of_isolated`,
`eq_bot_of_isolated`, the list plumbing (`entry_suffix`,
`getElem_mem_drop`) and `exists_avoiding`.

Two simplifications come out of recording rather than computing. The
generating set of a round is on the round itself, so the invariants
quantify over `e ∈ rounds` where the originals quantified over suffixes
`e :: older <:+ rounds`; and `pairR_disjoint` takes the older pair's
vertex through `gen` directly, so nothing has to name the older pair's
walk twice.

# What the program phase takes from here

A driver whose per-level data is its current arena `A` together with the
stack `rounds` of the rounds already played maintains
`ReachedR r G rounds A` as its invariant:

* it starts at `rounds = []`, `A = G`, where the invariant is
  `ReachedR.nil`;
* at each level it reads Connector's vertex `v`, marks a set `W` inside
  the ball of the round which contains `v` and, for each earlier round
  its search reaches, the support of the walk that search found, and
  moves to the arena `W` isolates; `reachedR_descend` says in one step
  that this is a round of the recorded game — it produces the `gen` the
  round records, which is `W` together with the parts of those supports
  that ran out of the ball;
* if `v` has no incident edge in `A` the round is over anyway, since the
  arena it leaves is edgeless (`nextArenaR_eq_bot_of_isolated`);
* the recursion terminates: `reachedR_length_lt` bounds the stack by
  `N (2·s + 2)`, since by `reachedR_no_survival` no play reaches that
  length.

`splitterWins_of_reachedR` is the same statement in the game's own terms,
available at every position the driver passes through.

No tactic in this file is handed a concept-side definition, exactly as in
`SplitterWin`: `WithinDist` and `DistIndependent` are opened by that
file's `Iff.rfl` lemmas, `SplitterWins` and `deleteVerts` by the clause
lemmas of `Lax3Proofs.SplitterBasics`, and balls by
`Lax3Proofs.WalkDistance`.

/-- **The extraction.** A play of `N (2·s + 2)` recorded rounds cannot
exist. Connector's vertices are `N (2·s + 2)` distinct vertices, so
quasi-wideness returns a separator `S` of at most `s` vertices and a
distance-`r` independent set `B` of at least `2·s + 2` of them. Pairing
the selected rounds off chronologically gives `s + 1` pairs whose
recorded walks are pairwise disjoint, so one of them avoids `S`; that
walk has length at most `r`, runs between two distinct members of `B` and
survives the deletion of `S`, contradicting the independence.

Nothing here looks at how large a batch is, which is why `ReachedR`
imposes no bound on one. -/

/-! ### The main induction -/

/-- Splitter wins from every recorded position, by downward induction on
the remaining round budget. From a reachable position with `b` rounds
still to play and `N (2·s + 2) − b` rounds recorded, Splitter wins within
`b` rounds: at budget zero the play would have `N (2·s + 2)` recorded
rounds, which `no_full_survivalR` excludes; with a round left, Splitter
plays `SplitterWin`'s own chosen batch — a legal recorded round, and the
one place a *choice* of walks is needed — and playing an isolated vertex
ends the play at once.

The continuation is `SplitterWin.genSet` at the recorded history read as
a list of `SplitterWin.Round`s, which is where the size of a batch is
paid for: one vertex plus one chosen walk of at most `r + 1` vertices per
recorded round. -/

/-! ### The driver-facing form

The three statements a program maintaining `ReachedR` needs: what a round
of the recorded game costs it, that the stack of played rounds is
bounded, and the measure that bound is.
-/

/-- **The descent step.** At a position reached with an edge still at the
connector `v`, a set `W` inside the ball of the round which contains `v`
and, for every earlier round the arena connects to `v`, the part of some
short walk's support that stays inside the ball, is the batch of a
recorded round: the round records `W` together with the parts of those
supports that ran out of the ball, and isolates exactly `W`.

This is the whole interface of the game to the program. The program owes
no equation between the walk it found and any other walk — only that the
support of the one it found is inside `W` where the ball keeps it. -/

/-! ### Monotone recorded positions

The executable driver only needs to retain a subgraph of the arena a
recorded round leaves.  This is the form compatible with a cover block:
the work arena may be restricted to the current cluster immediately,
without materialising the rest of Connector's ball.  All arguments used
by the quasi-wideness contradiction are monotone under this extra edge
deletion. -/

/-- Recorded positions in which a round may discard additional edges.
Each history entry still names the arena in which its connector was
played; only the position handed to the next round is allowed to lie
below the round's exact successor. -/

/-! ### The worked example

A recorded round is *data*, so the one thing a reader cannot check by
staring at `ReachedR` is whether its clauses can all be met at once — a
game no play can enter would make `no_full_survivalR` vacuous and the
driver's descent unprovable. These are the instances that say they can.

The arena is the triangle on `Fin 3` and the radius is `2`. Round one is
played at `0`, round two at `1`, and round two's walk clause is *not*
vacuous: the guard `WithinDist ⊤ 2 0 1` holds, so the round really has to
record the support `{0, 1}` of a walk.

The last example is the shape the program produces. At round two the
machine marks `W = {1}` alone: the walk it found from the ancestor `0`
has support `{0, 1}`, but `0` carries no edge in the round's arena — it
was isolated when round one was played — so `0` is outside the ball and
the `andCom` with the ball drops it. `reachedR_descend` still produces a
recorded round, which is the clause weakening the whole repair turns on.
