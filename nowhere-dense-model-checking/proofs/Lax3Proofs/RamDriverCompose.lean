Three of the **composition obligations of the driver**, discharged:
`Lax3Proofs.RamDriver.CoverImplements`,
`Lax3Proofs.RamDriver.BaseImplements` and — at `R = 0` —
`Lax3Proofs.RamDriver.OrderImplements`.

# What is proved here

* `coverImplements` — **the cover phase**. The two copies that set the
  pass up, `RamDriverOrder.coverPass_spec` — which is
  `RamCover.cover_spec` with its walk obligation already discharged —
  and the four copies of `RamDriver.coverSave` that make the answers
  the depth's own. `RamDriver.LevelPre` crosses the phase as a frame:
  the pass writes only the fixed scratch names and the depth's own
  four, and the level's state speaks about none of them except through
  `LevelMem` and `DepthMem`, which are lengths.
* `baseImplementsD` — **the base case**: `RamDriverBot.base_spec`
  translated into the surface, the frame off that file's four syntactic
  lemmas and the postcondition off `masked G M = ⊥`. The locality of the
  tabled formulas is not a hypothesis and does not need to be —
  `FormulaTables.tableRank_of_mem_tablesAt` is that every table entry is
  local.
* `orderImplements₀` — **the ordering phase at `R = 0`**: twelve passes,
  of which the two eliminations are `elimRank_spec` (below), the rank
  inversion is `RamDriverOrder.ordCom_spec`, the block-structure copies
  are `saveCsr_spec`/`restoreCsr_spec`, and the eight fills of the
  re-zeroing tail are `orderZero_spec`. At `R = 0` the augmentation fold
  is `Com.skip`, so the round's own obligation is never applied; the
  postcondition is unchanged, since it names only *some* ordering, and
  what the augmentation buys — the cover's degree, hence the cost — is
  the cost wave's business.

### Ledger — the tower search underneath (rebase P1)

**P1/B-g — nothing above the obligation boundary moved.** The cover
pass now embeds the refinement tower's synthesized queue BFS
(`Lax3Proofs.Refine.BfsBridge.bfsQCom`) where `RamBfs.bfsCom` stood.
Four lines of this file change and no statement does: the two `rfl`
lists `wvars_coverCom`/`wvars_coverPhase` grow by the tower's own
scalar cells (the arrays written, and so `warrs_coverCom` and
`warrs_coverPhase`, are the same two in the same order),
`noWrite_coverPhase` reads the tower's `Codegen.noWrite_embed` instead
of the old search's five constructors, and the call of
`coverPass_spec` passes `LevelMem`'s `q` word clause beside its `dist`
one (ledger P1/B-d in `RamCover`). `coverImplements` proves
`RamDriver.CoverImplements` at `coverPhaseCost n ns`, verbatim as
before — the per-centre budget absorbs the new constant (P1/B-e).

Three pieces of reusable machinery come with them.

* `levelPre_run` and `orderMem_run` — **a level's state is a frame**.
* `fillPrefix_spec` and `copyPrefix_spec` — **a flat pass over a prefix
  of a longer array**.
* `coverOut_off_le` and `coverOut_congr` — **the cover's answer reads
  the member array only below the write pointer**.

And three more for the ordering phase: `elimRank_spec` (the elimination
with the rank bound its own surface drops), `fillZero_spec` /
`elimRezero_spec` / `orderZero_spec` (the flat zeroing passes), and the
syntactic section that reads `RamDriver.orderCom`'s write sets off its
text.

# The three defects wave D4 repaired

**A — the program.** `RamDriver.orderCom` ran `RamElim.elimCom` twice
with nothing between them that re-zeroes `elm` or `bh`, so the second
call's `elimLoop` dropped every slot it popped, never advanced `cnt`,
and read `bh[n+1]` out of range: for `n ≥ 1` there was **no run**, and
the obligation was refuted rather than unproved. `RamDriver.elimRezeroCom`
— the `elm` and `bh` fills, and only those two, since they are the only
clauses of `RamElim.ElimPre` that ask for a value rather than a length —
is inserted between `fillCom "alv" 1` and the second elimination. See
`RamDriver.orderCom`'s docstring for the full record.

**B — the ordering surface.** `RamElim.Implements` takes
`RamElim.CsrSimple`, which is `RamBfs.CsrGraph` with *no row names a
vertex twice* — the clause `RamElim.card_liveSlots` needs to read a
degree off a row. `RamDriver.OrderImplements` carried only `CsrGraph`,
and a structure listing a neighbour twice double-counts that degree. The
obligation now takes `CsrSimple`, and `RamDriverCluster.levelImplements`
takes it and hands `hcsr.csr` to the cover phase and the cluster step.

It is **not derivable from the input encoding**:
`Lax11.GraphEncoding.EncodesGraph`'s own note says that repetitions in a
block are deliberately not forbidden, the encoding being the dumbest
possible input format, and `m` is only the declared half-length of the
target array. So the clause is one more piece of *data of the input
word* — "no block of the word names a vertex twice" — and the root has
to supply it. (It is equivalent to the word's declared `m` being the
true edge count.)

**C — the scratch's word clause.** `orderCom` copies the *whole* of the
in-list target array, `copyUpto "itg" "dtg" (.lit W)`, while an
elimination fills only the `m ≤ ns` cells its own arcs occupy; the tail
above `m` is whatever the memory held, and a cell at or above the word
bound has no bounded evaluation. Any state satisfying `LevelPre` whose
`itg` holds `B` at a cell above the last arc therefore gives the phase
no run, and the obligation was again refuted.
`RamDriver.OrderMem` therefore gains `B` as a parameter and two clauses,
`itg` and `ntg` hold words — the same species as its eight zeroing
clauses, true of a machine's memory for the same reason, and neither is
a frame condition, since a bounded run stores only words. `ntg` is
`augRelinkCom`'s copy and is not reached at `R = 0`; it is carried
because it is the same defect one round later.

# The frontier for the wave that follows

**Closed at rebase F-c-5**: the `Rstar` section at the end of this file
now *discharges* the `R`-round phase — `orderImplementsR` proves
`OrderImplementsR` under the three mathematical hypotheses its
docstring names, exporting the `OrderP` chain bundle the root's `hdeg`
slot consumes through `RamDriverRoot.wreachDeg_of_orderP`. The two
couplings this paragraph used to record as open were closed by F-c-2
and F-c-4 (the `tgt` flip) and coupling (b) (`TgtCoupling.chainWidth`);
the round
itself is `RamDriverAugment.implementsW`. What the fold walk found and
repaired on the way — the round's entry was refuted as landed — is the
`Rstar` section header's F-c-5 record.

The end-to-end instantiation of `RamDriver.driver_correct` is
`Lax3Proofs.RamDriverRoot.driverRoot_decides_sentence`, at `R = 0` and
with costs parametric. What wave E2 had to move to get there — all three
of what this header used to list as missing — is recorded at its two
sites and summarized here.

* `RamDriver.AugAvail B n` is `RamDriverAugment.implements` (wave E1c).
  `RamDriver.ElimAvail` is `RamElim.implements` and
  `RamDriver.CoverAvail` is `RamDriverOrder.coverTurnImplements`.
* `RamDriverFrames.clusterFrames` and
  `RamDriverCluster.clusterStepImplements` took the family of
  `RamDriverCluster.InnerFrames` as a parameter, and `InnerFrames` is a
  `Spec` of the *nested driver*, so producing it needs that driver's
  termination — which is exactly the `hinner` those two carry as an
  antecedent. The hypothesis now sits **under** it:
  `clusterStepImplements`'s `hfr` takes
  `RamDriverCluster.InnerAvail` first, and `clusterFrames` takes
  `RamDriverFrames.innerFrames`' syntactic side and builds the family
  itself. The bit clause `InnerAvail` needs is the ninth conjunct of
  `RamDriver.LevelPre` at the next depth, so nothing else moved.
* `RamDriverCluster.levelImplements` still takes the *mathematics* of
  the campaign — `hQ`, uniform quasi-wideness of the arena at the radius
  `2·cap`, and `hℓ : ℓ = N (2s+2)` — and the cost side conditions, and
  the end-to-end theorem carries both: the first is the campaign's own
  input, the second is the cost wave's business.

Two clauses of `TurnFrozen` had to go, and not for convenience: a level
writes the padding buffer `"wa"` and every one of `RamDriver.OrderMem`'s
eight accumulators, so asking the nested call to leave them alone was
*refutable* — see `RamDriverWrites.wa_mem_warrs_driverAt` and
`elm_mem_warrs_driverAt`. The accumulators now come back from
`RamDriver.LevelPost`, and the buffer moved out of
`RamDriverCluster.ClusterData` into `ClusterWa`, live only between the
padding and the colouring.

/-! ### The frame of a level's state

`RamDriver.LevelPre` is thirteen clauses, of which two are scalars, five
are named arrays, and the last four survive any run outright. So a pass
that writes none of the seven names carries the whole clause across, and
that is what every phase of a level does with it. -/

only words, whether or not it writes the array. -/

/-! ### A copy into a prefix of a longer array

`RamDriverOrder.copyUpto_spec` — like everything built on
`Lax13Proofs.Reasoning.Lib.Fill.Below` — pins the destination's length
to the copy's bound. One pass of the driver does not have that shape:
`RamDriver.coverSave`'s member copy runs to the cover's write pointer
`xp`, while the destination `xmmName j` is the depth's own `n * n`-cell
array, and `RamDriver.DepthMem` sizes it there and nowhere else.

So the pass is restated with the destination's length a second
parameter, at or above the bound. Nothing else changes: the store's
range obligation is `i < N ≤ Na`, and the postcondition speaks only
about the cells below `N` — the tail of the destination is *not* claimed
to be untouched, and is not, since a shorter earlier copy may have left
anything there. -/

/-! ### Two readings of the cover's answer

The cluster arena occupies the member array only up to the write pointer
the pass left, so the block offsets are below it and the answer does not
depend on the array above it. Both are what makes the *partial* copy of
`RamDriver.coverSave` as good as the whole array. -/

/-! ### The cover phase

`RamDriver.coverPhase` is the depth's ordering into the name the pass
reads, the depth's mask into the name it destroys,
`RamCover.coverCom` — whose walk is landed as
`RamDriverOrder.coverPass_spec`, with no obligation left in it — and the
four copies of `RamDriver.coverSave` that make the answers the depth's
own.

The only clause of the level's state the pass touches is none: it writes
`ord`, `alv`, `asg`, `xoff`, `xmem`, the two scratch arrays of the
search, and the depth's own four names, and `RamDriver.LevelPre` speaks
about none of them except through `LevelMem` and `DepthMem`, which are
lengths. So the whole clause crosses the phase by `levelPre_run`. -/

/-! ### The compaction scan

**Rebase B3.** `RamDriver.compactCom` is the last pass of the cover
phase: one scan of the depth's own block offsets, listing the positions
whose block is nonempty. The level's centre loop iterates that list
instead of the carrier, which is what takes the recursion's turn count
off `n` and onto the arena's mass.

The invariant is the obvious one — below the counter, every position
with a nonempty block has been listed, in increasing order — with one
clause that is not obvious and is the whole point: **the count never
overtakes the block offsets**, `cnum ≤ Xoff i`. Each listed position
contributes at least one member, and the members of the positions below
`i` all sit below `Xoff i`; at the exit `i = n` that reads
`cnum ≤ Xoff n = mm`. -/

/-- The invariant of `RamDriver.compactCom`. **Rebase B8:** the two
arrays the aliveness test reads, and the aliveness of every listed
position, join it. -/

theorem cpsName_ne_xofName (j a : ℕ) : cpsName j ≠ xofName a := by
  simp [cpsName, xofName, String.ext_iff]

/-- **One turn of the compaction scan.** The block at the counter is
tested for emptiness and its centre for aliveness; if it is neither empty
nor dead the position is appended to the list and the count goes up.

**Rebase B8.** The inner test is the whole point of the pass: it is what
takes the level's turn count off the carrier and onto the *arena*
(`Refine.ArenaBlock.cnum_le_arenaSize`). The dead positions it drops are
the ones whose rows `RamDriver.sweepCom` has already written. -/

/-! ### The base case

`RamDriverBot.base_spec` is the walk; what is left is the translation
into the surface. Two halves. The frame of `RamDriver.LevelPre` across
the pass comes off the four syntactic lemmas of that file — the base
pass writes the depth's own tables and the generated evaluator's own
names, and `LevelPre` speaks about neither. (Before R1.8-T4a it also
wrote the representative table; the frame lemmas still carry that
alternative, vacuously — `RamDriverBot.rep_notMem_warrs_baseCom`.) And
the postcondition `RamDriverBot.BaseTabOk … (fun _ => n)` is
`RamDriver.TableInv`'s content on the edgeless arena, which is the arena
the obligation's hypothesis says this is.

The locality of the tabled formulas is not a hypothesis of the
obligation and does not have to be:
`Lax3Proofs.FormulaTables.tableRank_of_mem_tablesAt` is that every entry
of every table is local. -/

the base pass's frame needs: it writes the tables and the names below its
own output, neither of which starts there. -/

/-- **The base case of the driver, discharged** (wave R1.8-T4b: at the
domain form of the obligation, and at the arena's size).

The cost slot is a parameter with one condition: the budget covers the
depth's charge read at `RamDriver.arenaSize n M`. That is where the whole
wave lands — the walk itself pays `RamDriverBot.baseCost … mm φ` at the
member count, `RamDriver.MemEnum.card_le_arenaSize` puts `mm` under the
arena, and `RamDriverBot.baseCost_mono` closes the gap. Before T4b the
slot was the constant `baseCost … n φ`, at the carrier, which no
weight-linear budget dominates (`Refine.G2CostProbe.hKbase_gap_any`).

The domain `D` rides through `RamDriverBot.base_spec`'s own `Dm`: its
rows come in with the precondition's `RamDriver.TableInvOn`, the walk
never stores off the member list, and `masked G M = ⊥` is what makes the
incoming reading (`Sat (masked G M)`) and the walk's (`Sat ⊥`) the same
question. -/

/-! ### The elimination's rank bound

`Lax3Proofs.RamElim.ElimMem` — and so `RamElim.ElimPost` — does **not**
say that the ranks it leaves are vertex numbers, and nothing in it
implies that: `RamElim.ElimCert` is invariant under any order-preserving
relabelling of the rank, so `ρ` and `100·ρ` satisfy the whole of it
alike. The elimination's own walk knows better — `RamElim.AfterLoop` and
`RamElim.AfterOff` both carry `∀ v < n, R v < n`, and
`RamElim.elimLoop_spec` produces it — but the last phase drops it on the
way out.

`RamDriver.ordCom` cannot do without it: it stores at the index
`rnk[z]`, and an out-of-range store has no derivation, so the ordering
phase has *no run* unless the rank is bounded. So the five phase walks
are sequenced again here, with the clause kept. Nothing of the engine is
re-proved — `initDeg_spec`, `initBuck_spec`, `elimLoop_spec`,
`offPass_spec` and `fillPass_spec` are used exactly as
`RamElim.implements` uses them, against the same four predicates — and
the only difference is the last phase's postcondition, which keeps the
rank array and its bound (and its injectivity, so that a caller reading
both gets them for *one* function rather than two that happen to agree
below `n`).

**Defect record.** The proper repair is one conjunct in
`RamElim.ElimMem`, which `RamElim.implements`'s own `w5` has in hand.
The engines are frozen for this wave, so it is done here instead; a wave
that may edit `RamElim` should move it there and delete this. -/

variable {n : ℕ}

/-- **The elimination, with the rank bound its own surface drops — at
the widened input surface** (rebase F-c-2). The bridge is re-sequenced
from the engine's *widened* phase walks (`RamElim.initDeg_specW`,
`RamElim.elimLoop_specW`, `RamElim.fillPass_specW`, against the
`AfterXW` predicates), so the block structure it reads may live in a
target array wider than the call's own slot count.

That is what the ordering phase's *second* elimination needs: what it
eliminates is the symmetrization's `RamElim.CsrSimple (D R).toGraph
(m + m)`, whose slot count is the chain's arc count and not the
level's, while the array it sits in is the one the level allocated.
Nothing else moves — the three answers and the cost are the pinned
bridge's, which is now this one at `nt = ns`.

The counterpart on the round's side is
`RamDriverAugment.elimCert_specW`, which keeps the *certificate*
instead of the injectivity; the two die together with the same defect
record. -/

`RamDriver.orderCom 0 j` assigns no scalar the level's state names and
writes no array of it except `off` and `tgt` — which `restoreCsr` puts
back — and the eight of `OrderMem`'s zeroing half, which the tail puts
back. Its scalar write set does not mention `W` or `j` at all, so it is
the write set at `0 0`; its array write set mentions `j` once, at the

/-- **The cost of the ordering phase at `R = 0`**: the two eliminations,
the four block-structure copies, the two in-list copies, the
symmetrization, the mask fill and the ten zeroing fills. The constants
are generous, as everywhere in this campaign: the sharp charging is the
cost wave's business.

**Rebase F-c-4.** The two block-structure copies are bounded by the
allocation width `W` rather than by the slot count `ns`, since that is
the array the level owns, so the `W` coefficient absorbs their `28·W`.

**Rebase F-c-2.** The symmetrization adds `RamDriverAugment.symCost n m
= 200·n + 100·m + 200` with `m` the chain's arc count, and
`m + m ≤ ns` at `R = 0` (`RamDriverAugment.two_mul_arcs_le`), so the
addend is read here at `200·n + 100·ns + 200`. The second elimination
got *cheaper* — it runs at the slot count `m + m ≤ ns` rather than at
`ns` — so nothing else moves. -/

/-- **The ordering phase of a level, discharged at `R = 0`.**

Twelve passes. `saveCsr` and `restoreCsr` are
`RamDriverOrder.saveCsr_spec`/`restoreCsr_spec`, the two eliminations
are `elimRank_spec`, the rank inversion is
`RamDriverOrder.ordCom_spec` — the only mathematics in the phase, since
its postcondition names no ordering in particular — and the rest is
`fillCom_spec`, `copyUpto_spec` and the two zeroing specifications
above. At `R = 0` the augmentation fold is `Com.skip`, so
`RamDriver.AugAvail` is never applied and `RamElim.Implements` enters
through `elimRank_spec` rather than through `RamDriver.ElimAvail`,
which the obligation therefore carries unused.

The level's state crosses the phase clause by clause and not as a
frame: `off` and `tgt` are written by `restoreCsr` and put back to what
they were, and the eight zeroed arrays are written by both eliminations
and put back by `orderZeroCom`. Everything else — the two scalars, the
depth's own four arrays, the lengths, the value bounds and the two word
clauses — crosses by the syntactic section above. -/

/-! ### The `R*` phase (rebase F-c-3, statement; F-c-5, walk)

`orderImplements₀` is the phase at `R = 0`, where the fold is
`Com.skip` and the parametric slot `P` is `True`. At `R = R*` the fold
is the point of the phase, and what it produces is
`Lax3Proofs.CoverDegree.AugChainData` — the six-clause bundle F-c-2
anchored the slot on. This section states the slot value `OrderP`, the
cost `orderPhaseCostR`, the obligation `OrderImplementsR` naming both —
and, since rebase F-c-5, **discharges it**: `orderImplementsR` at the
bottom of the section is the walk.

The walk's shape is F-c-3's residual list, executed:

1. **The fold** is `fold_run_aux` over `fold_step`: the invariant
   `FoldInv` carries the machine state *and* the chain built so far,
   `RamDriverAugment.implementsW` runs each round, and the chain grows
   by `RamAugment.AugPost`'s `AugStep`/`GreedyFratRound` clauses.
2. **The width**: one `W` serves every round, by
   `Augmentation.greedy_chain_inDegLE` + `TgtCoupling.budget_mono` +
   `augWidth_mono` against the hypothesis `chainWidth n d D₁ R ≤ W`.
3. **The two ends**: the first elimination's `RamElim.ElimPost` is kept
   (the foot `d₀ = ka` with its minimality against the arena), and so is
   the second's, on the symmetrized `(D R).toGraph` (the head `k` with
   its minimality) — F-c-3 recorded both as dropped, not missing, and
   that was exact.
4. **The syntax section** at general `R`: the fold's write sets are the
   round's (`mem_warrs_foldRange_const` and friends), and the round
   writes no per-depth name.
5. **`AugmentedDepthOneDensity`** enters as the hypothesis `hdens`,
   quantified over every chain the fold could build, and leaves through
   `P` — the one unproved statement of `Augmentation`, inherited, not
   this walk's debt. `hd` — a degeneracy bound of the arena — anchors
   the width budget at statement level.
6. **The cost**: `relinkCost` (walked at F-c-4, repaired **again** at
   F-c-5 — see its docstring; the fold walk refuted the *round* as
   landed and the repair `RamDriver.augPrepCom` is three more per-round
   passes), `RamAugment.augCost` for the round itself, and
   `orderPhaseCostR`'s fixed part for the twelve steps outside the
   fold. At `R = 0` the walk reproduces the landed budget: the
   `i = 0` clause of `FoldInv` keeps `m + m ≤ ns` so the symmetrization
   and the final elimination charge at `ns` exactly as
   `orderImplements₀` does. At `R ≥ 1` both charge at `W`, and *that*
   refuted F-c-3's round coefficient too — the third cost repair, the
   `650·W` surcharge; see `orderPhaseCostR`'s docstring and the
   accounting `#guard`s beside it.

**The defect the walk found (F-c-5).** The fold body as landed —
`augCom ; augRelinkCom` — had no run at `R ≥ 1`: `RamAugment.AugPre`
asks for `off`, `elm` and `bh` zeroed at every round's entry, the
phase's first elimination dirties `elm`/`bh`, `off` holds the level's
structure until the first relink, and the relink re-zeroes `off` but
never `elm`/`bh` (the round's *inner* elimination re-dirties them).
Wave D4's defect A, one pass earlier, found by walking the round's
entry against `AugPreW` and compiled in `TgtWidenProbe`'s R = 1 gate:
the old text is stuck on a `K₁,₄` level state, the prepped one runs and
reports the augmented graph's bound. The repair — `augPrepCom` inside
the fold body `augRoundCom` — keeps the `R = 0` text byte-identical. -/

/-- **The `R*` phase's ordering property**, the value its parametric
slot `P` takes: the ordering `π` the phase built carries an `R`-round
greedy augmentation chain of the depth's arena, with the two elimination
bounds at its ends. This is `CoverDegree.AugChainData` with the
orientation family and the two bounds existentially quantified — the
phase knows they exist, the consumer needs nothing else.

The order array is not mentioned: the chain is a statement about the
permutation, and `RamCover.OrdersBy` is what ties the array to it. -/

/-- At `R = 0` the bundle degenerates to the two elimination bounds of
the level's own arena (`CoverDegree.augChainData_zero`) and says nothing
about augmentation — which is why `orderImplements₀` instantiates the
slot at `True` and not at this. -/

/-- **The bookkeeping between two rounds, charged.** `augRelinkCom` is
two copies and seven flat fills, and this is the sum of their nine kit
costs — not a guess.

**Rebase F-c-4: the constant was wrong.** F-c-3 landed this as `100·n +
20·W + 100`, marked "generous, not yet walked". Walking it
(`relinkCostSum` below, and `relinkCostSum_le` for the comparison) gives
`97·n + 12·W + 115`, whose *constant* is above `100`: the old bound is
refuted at every carrier below five vertices —
`relinkCost_old_refuted` is that falsification at `n = W = 0`. The `n` and `W` coefficients were indeed
generous; the constant was not, and a phase obligation stated at the old
number could not have been discharged.

**Rebase F-c-5: the round gained a prep pass.** The fold walk found the
round *itself* refuted as landed — `RamAugment.AugPre` asks for `off`,
`elm` and `bh` zeroed, and nothing between the phase's first elimination
and a round re-zeroes them (see `RamDriver.augPrepCom`'s defect record
and `TgtWidenProbe`'s R = 1 gate). The repair's three fills are per-round
bookkeeping of the same species as the nine relink passes, so this
constant is now the budget for **twelve** passes: `prepCostSum +
relinkCostSum = 134·n + 12·W + 163`, and F-c-4's `100·n + 20·W + 120` is
below that at every carrier (its `n` coefficient already fails at
`W = 0`, `n` large). `prep_relink_le` is the repaired comparison. -/

/-- **The cost of the ordering phase at `R` rounds**: the `R = 0`
phase, plus `R` times a round, its bookkeeping, and the widened tail's
surcharge. The shape is what P3's `CostRecurrence` consumes — linear in
`R` with a single coefficient — and the `R = 0` instance is
`orderPhaseCost` on the nose.

**Rebase F-c-5: the third cost repair of this section.** F-c-3 landed
the coefficient as `augCost + relinkCost` alone, and the fold walk
refutes *that* too: at `R ≥ 1` the symmetrization and the final
elimination run at up to `W` slots — `2·m ≤ ns` is an `R = 0` fact —
so their budgets are `100·m + …` and `600·(m + m) + …` with only
`m + m ≤ W` to charge them against, up to `650·W` beyond the `60·W` the
fixed part carries; and the round term is consumed by the fold's own
component budgets, whose slack (`prep_relink_le`'s margin) is `8·W` a
round. The `#guard` below is the accounting at the smallest widened
shape (`n = 0`, `W = 2`, `m + m = W`, `R = 1`): the walk's component
budgets sum to `26194` against the old budget's `24980`. The surcharge
`650·W` is charged per round though the tail runs once, because the
budget's `R`-shape wants one coefficient; it is sound at every `R ≥ 1`,
and at `R = 0` the tail fits the fixed part exactly as
`orderImplements₀` proved. -/

live width `σ.vars "lw"`, not merely the allocation width. `d`/`D₁` —
the degeneracy bound and the density constant the budget reads — are
parameters here because the clause has nowhere else to name them.

The clause is load-bearing, not slack: `RamDriver.OrderMem` now pins
only `ns ≤ lw ≤ W`, and at `lw = ns` the `R = 1` phase's chain
overruns the prefix the copies preserve — `TgtWidenProbe`'s
`ordLive8Run` boundary gate is that refutation, compiled. Without the
clause this obligation is **refutable**, which is why the live width

times, and everything a frame lemma wants of it — its write sets, its
output silence — is the body's. The body of the ordering phase's fold is
`RamDriver.augRoundCom`, whose write sets do not depend on the width
parameter (it appears only inside expressions). -/

One width serves every round. Historically `TgtCoupling.chainWidth` was
`RamAugment.augWidth` at the last round's budget (`chainWidth_eq_augWidth`
below, kept as the record); since rebase G2/E2 the fold runs at the
degree-aware `TgtCoupling.chainWidthE`, which carries no `n · n` room, so
`fold_step` derives the round's two capacities directly — the fraternity
term from `budget_mono` and the raw assembly arcs from
`TgtCoupling.two_sq_add_le_budget_succ` — and enters the round through
`RamDriverAugment.augment_specWE`. -/

/-- **The relink, walked**: the round's output block structure into the
next round's input, and the seven accumulators and stamps zeroed.

**The target copy walks the live prefix** (rebase G2/E2b): the bound is
the scalar `"lw"`, whose runtime value `lw` may sit strictly below the
allocation width `W`, so the destination `dtg` comes back as the copied
`lw`-prefix of `NT` over whatever tail it already had — the fold's
`inCsr_congr_prefix` step is what makes that as good as the whole
array, the chain's arcs living below `chainWidthE ≤ lw`. The cost reads
`relinkCostSum n lw`. -/

/-! ### The fold's invariant

What is true between two rounds: the machine holds the chain-so-far's
last orientation as the next round's input block structure, the
accumulators and stamps the relink re-zeroed, and the chain itself — the
family `D`, grown a round at a time, with the two clauses
`Augmentation.greedy_chain_inDegLE` consumes and the first elimination's
in-degree bound at its foot. `elm`, `bh` and `off` are *not* here: each
round's prep re-zeroes them, which is the F-c-5 repair. -/

/-- The invariant of the ordering phase's fold, after `i` rounds.

**Live width** (rebase G2/E2b): the scalar `"lw"` holds the runtime
value `lw` — between `ns` and `W`, no longer pinned to `W` — the `tgt`
tail at or above it stays zero across every round (the level's own
padding, which the restore counts on), and the chain-so-far's arc
count sits below `lw`, which is what lets each relink's live-prefix
copy carry the whole block structure. -/

/-- **One round of the fold preserves the invariant** — the
chain-carrying step. The prep re-zeroes what the previous elimination
dirtied, `RamDriverAugment.implementsW` runs the round at the one width
`W`, `RamAugment.AugPost` hands back the augmentation step, the greedy
clause and the output block structure, and the relink makes that
structure the next round's input. The chain grows by
`Augmentation.isAugChain_succ`'s reading: the family is updated at
`i + 1` and nothing below moves. -/

/-! ### The rank inversion, with its data

`RamDriverOrder.ordCom_spec`'s postcondition quantifies the permutation
away, and at `R = 0` that is enough — the phase's postcondition names
only *some* ordering. The `R*` phase's slot is about the ordering the
**final elimination** produced, so the walk needs the inversion facts
the landed lemma's loop invariant carries and its last step drops: the
order array inverts the rank array. This is that lemma with the final
weakening removed; the loop is `ordCom_spec`'s, step for step. -/

/-! ### The theorem -/

set_option maxHeartbeats 4000000 in
/-- **The ordering phase at `R` rounds, discharged.** The thirteen-step
walk of `orderImplements₀` at a general round count: the fold is the
chain-carrying induction `fold_run_aux`/`fold_step`, the two
eliminations *keep* the `RamElim.ElimPost`s the `R = 0` walk discards —
the first is the foot of the chain (`d₀` and its minimality against the
arena), the second, on the symmetrized graph of the chain's last
orientation, is its head (`k` and its minimality against
`(D R).toGraph`) — and the rank inversion keeps the inversion facts, so
the exported ordering is provably the final elimination's. What comes
out through the parametric slot is `OrderP`: the six-clause
`CoverDegree.AugChainData` bundle, which
`RamDriverRoot.wreachDeg_of_orderP` turns into the root's cover-degree
coefficient `hdeg`.

The three hypotheses beyond the obligation's own are the campaign's
mathematics, not the machine's: `hd` is a degeneracy bound of the
arena (what `d₀`'s minimality is measured against, and the foot of the
width budget), `hdens` is `Augmentation.AugmentedDepthOneDensity` for
every chain the fold could build — the one unproved statement of
`Augmentation`, inherited here as that file's header says it must be —
and `hWc` says the level's allocation width covers
`TgtCoupling.chainWidthE` — the degree-aware width (rebase G2/E2),
whose `ns` term replaces the old `chainWidth`'s fatal `n · n` — the one
width that serves every round (coupling (b) of F-c-3's design, repaired
per `g2-cost-design.md` §3(a)). At `R = 0` the obligation reduces to
the landed `orderImplements₀`'s: the fold is `Com.skip`, the cost is
`orderPhaseCost` on the nose (`orderPhaseCostR_zero`), and the slot
degenerates to the two elimination bounds
(`CoverDegree.augChainData_zero`). -/
