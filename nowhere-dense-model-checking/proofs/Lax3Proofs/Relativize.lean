/-!
The **relativization rewrite**: a syntactic translation `rel` that turns
satisfaction *inside* a vertex subset into plain satisfaction over the
arena with the complement of that subset isolated.

The evaluator of this submission reads a formula's truth inside a
cluster of a neighborhood cover. Semantic locality
(`Lax3Proofs.SemLocal`) says that a local formula of distance rank
`(k, q)` cannot tell the whole arena from the substructure induced on
any set containing the ρ⁻-balls around its tuple, so the evaluator may
replace `Sat A col m β` by `SatWithin X A col m β` for a cluster `X`
holding those balls. But `SatWithin` is not the shape the recursion
runs on: to isolate a splitter batch inside the cluster and descend, the
evaluator needs a *plain* satisfaction statement over a *smaller arena*.
That is what `rel` provides — it rewrites `β` into a formula which, over
the arena `deleteVerts A Xᶜ` with the outside of the cluster isolated,
says exactly what `β` said inside the cluster. The cluster survives the
move only as data: a marker color.

# Why every atom case is exact

Two devices remove all side conditions, so `sat_rel` holds at *every*
tuple, with no hypothesis relating the tuple to the cluster.

*The arena carries the edge conjuncts.* An edge of `deleteVerts A Xᶜ` is
an edge of `A` with both endpoints outside `Xᶜ`, that is, both endpoints
in the cluster — verbatim the conjuncts `SatWithin` puts on an adjacency
atom. Adjacency atoms therefore translate to themselves.

*The coloring carries the color conjuncts.* The target coloring is
assumed pre-intersected with the cluster, `col' (old c) = col c ∩ X`,
which is how the evaluator builds it anyway; a color atom translates to
a color atom with nothing added.

What neither device knows is where the isolated part of the arena is: an
isolated vertex is adjacent to nothing, but it is still within distance
`d` of itself, and the empty walk at it is a walk. The **marker color**
`col' mk = X` repairs exactly those endpoint cases. A binary distance
atom picks up a marker conjunct at each of its two endpoints, a unary one
at its single free endpoint, and each quantifier — unrestricted or local
— picks one up on the vertex it binds, which is what confines
quantification to the cluster. Nothing is needed away from the
endpoints: every edge of the isolated arena has both ends in `X`, so a
walk that starts in the cluster never leaves it. The two walk-conversion
lemmas below, `withinDistIn_of_withinDist_deleteVerts_compl` and
`withinDist_deleteVerts_compl_of_withinDistIn`, are that observation, and
everything the induction of `sat_rel` does with distances reduces to
them.

# Where it is used

In the evaluator's cluster step: for a cluster `X` of the cover,
`Lax3Proofs.SemLocal.sat_iff_satWithin_of_ball_subset'` moves from the
arena to the cluster, `sat_rel` moves from the cluster back to plain
satisfaction over the cluster arena, and the isolation rewrite of the
splitter batch then applies inside that arena. `drank_rel` and
`isLocal_rel` carry the two syntactic invariants the next level of the
recursion consumes: the translated formula has the same distance rank
and is again local, so semantic locality applies to it in turn.

/-! ### Walks in the isolated arena

Isolating the complement of `X` and staying inside `X` are the same
condition on a walk, once one endpoint is known to lie in `X`. Both
directions are proved at the level of walks, keeping the length, so that
the `≤ d` of a binary distance atom and the `< r` of a unary one read
off the same two lemmas.

in `X`, is a walk of the original arena of the same length that stays

the containment propagates from the first vertex along the walk; a walk
of length zero is covered by either endpoint hypothesis. -/

variable {L L' n : ℕ}

/-- The relativization of a formula to a vertex subset recorded as the
marker color `mk`, with the old colors relocated along `old`.

Adjacency atoms are unchanged — the isolated arena's edges already carry
the membership conjuncts — and so are equality atoms; a color atom only
moves to its new slot, the coloring being assumed pre-intersected with
the subset. The marker conjuncts appear exactly where the isolated arena
cannot see the subset on its own: at the endpoints of a distance atom,
and at the vertex each quantifier binds, which is what restricts
quantification to the subset. -/

/-! ### Correctness -/

/-- **The relativization rewrite.** Over the arena with the complement
of `X` isolated and a coloring that carries the old colors
pre-intersected with `X` and `X` itself as the marker `mk`, the
relativized formula says exactly what the original formula says inside
`X`.

There is no hypothesis on the tuple `m`: the marker conjuncts make every
atom case an equivalence rather than an implication, so the statement is
uniform in the tuple, as the evaluator needs it to be. -/
