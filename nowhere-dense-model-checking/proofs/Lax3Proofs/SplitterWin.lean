Splitter wins the isolation splitter game on every member of a nowhere
dense class — the discharge of
`Lax3.NowhereDenseSplitter.splitterWins_of_nowhereDense`, Lemma 4.2 of
Chapter 4 of the source lecture notes (Theorem 4.2 of
Grohe–Kreutzer–Siebertz) transposed to the isolation variant.

Everything is driven by the quasi-wideness margins of the class at the
game radius `r`, taken from Lax12's endorsed
`uniformlyQuasiWide_of_nowhereDense`: a threshold function `N` and a
separator bound `s`. The bounds are `ℓ = N (2·s + 2)` rounds and
`m = ℓ · (r + 1)` vertices per batch.

# The strategy

Splitter maintains, towards every vertex Connector has played, a walk of
length at most `r` — the canonical gradient walk `pathSet`, determined
once and for all in the arena that earlier round was played in
(`Lax3Proofs.BatchCanon`, F6c12p: choice-free, so a machine pass can be
proved to store it) — and in each round isolates the
vertices of those walks that are still in the current ball, together with
Connector's new vertex (`genSet`, cut down to the ball by `batch`). That
is one vertex plus one path of at most `r + 1` vertices per round played,
so at most `m` after fewer than `ℓ` rounds.

A play is a list of rounds, newest first, each recording Connector's
vertex together with the arena it was picked in; `Reached` collects the
positions of the plays in which every Connector move still had an
incident edge. Moves on isolated vertices need no history: the ball
around such a vertex is the vertex alone, so the round leaves an edgeless
arena and Splitter has already won (`eq_bot_of_isolated`).

# Why no play lasts `ℓ` rounds

This is `no_full_survival`, the heart of the file. After `ℓ` rounds
Connector has played `ℓ` distinct vertices (`picks_nodup`), so
quasi-wideness returns a separator `S` with at most `s` vertices and a
distance-`r` independent set `B` of at least `2·s + 2` of them. Pairing
the rounds that selected a vertex of `B` off chronologically gives
`s + 1` pairs, each with the strategy's walk between its two vertices,
inside the older round's arena (`pair_walk`).

Two ingredients replace the notes' "removed vertices are gone", which the
isolation variant cannot use.

* *Isolation is permanent* (`isolated_of_suffix`): arenas only ever lose
  edges, so a vertex the strategy isolated in some round has no incident
  edge in any later arena — either it left the ball the round restricted
  to, or it was in the batch, and both are forever.
* *Distinct pairs' walks are disjoint* (`pair_disjoint`): a vertex on an
  older pair's walk belongs to the batch-generating set of that pair's
  newer round, hence is isolated from then on; but every vertex of a
  newer pair's walk carries an edge in an arena strictly after that
  round, because the walk is not trivial — its endpoints are distinct,
  the older one being already isolated where the newer one still had an
  edge.

So the `s + 1` walks are pairwise disjoint and, `S` having at most `s`
vertices, one of them avoids `S` (`exists_avoiding`). Rebuilt inside
`deleteVerts G S` — a single induction on the walk, since the arena is a
subgraph of `G` and the walk avoids `S` — it is a walk of length at most
`r` between two distinct members of `B`, which is exactly what
`DistIndependent (deleteVerts G S) r B` forbids.

# The round bound

The notes state `ℓ = N (2·s + 1)`, but their own proof extracts `s + 1`
pairwise disjoint paths so that one avoids the separator, and that needs
`2·s + 2` selected rounds. The `+ 2` form is taken here, as the
formalization notes of `Lax3.NowhereDenseSplitter` record; nothing else
about the notes' argument changes.

No tactic in this file is handed a concept-side definition: `WithinDist`
and `DistIndependent` are opened by the `Iff.rfl` lemmas of the first
section, `SplitterWins` and `deleteVerts` by the clause lemmas of
`Lax3Proofs.SplitterBasics`, and balls by `Lax3Proofs.WalkDistance`.

/-! ### No play lasts `N (2s + 2)` rounds -/

/-- **The extraction.** A play of `N (2·s + 2)` rounds cannot exist.
Connector's vertices are `N (2·s + 2)` distinct vertices, so
quasi-wideness returns a separator `S` of at most `s` vertices and a
distance-`r` independent set `B` of at least `2·s + 2` of them. Pairing
the selected rounds off chronologically gives `s + 1` pairs whose
maintained paths are pairwise disjoint, so one of them avoids `S`; that
path is a walk of length at most `r` between two distinct members of `B`
which survives the deletion of `S`, contradicting the independence. -/

/-! ### The main induction -/

/-- Splitter's strategy, by downward induction on the remaining round
budget. From a reachable position with `b` rounds still to play and
`N (2·s + 2) − b` rounds played, Splitter wins within `b` rounds: at
budget zero the play would have lasted `N (2·s + 2)` rounds, which
`no_full_survival` excludes; with a round left, playing the batch keeps
the position reachable and playing an isolated vertex ends the play at
once. -/

conclusion: Lax3.NowhereDenseSplitter.splitterWins_of_nowhereDense
---
**Splitter wins on nowhere dense classes** (Lemma 4.2 of Chapter 4 of the
source lecture notes, Theorem 4.2 of Grohe–Kreutzer–Siebertz, in the
isolation variant): on a nowhere dense class, for every radius `r` there
are a round bound `ℓ` and a batch bound `m`, depending only on the class
and `r`, with which Splitter wins the `(ℓ, m, r)`-game on every member.

# Proof strategy

Take the quasi-wideness margins `N, s` of the class at radius `r` from
the endorsed `Lax12.NowhereDenseUQW.uniformlyQuasiWide_of_nowhereDense`
and put `ℓ := N (2·s + 2)` and `m := ℓ · (r + 1)`. Splitter's strategy
isolates, in each round, Connector's new vertex `v` together with the
still-active vertices of a chosen walk of length at most `r` from every
earlier Connector vertex to `v`, taken in the arena that earlier round
was played in — one vertex plus one path of at most `r + 1` vertices per
round played, which is the bound `m`. A play in which every Connector
move still had an incident edge is recorded by `Reached`; moves on
isolated vertices end the play at once, since the ball around such a
vertex is the vertex alone.

The whole content is that no play lasts `ℓ` rounds. Connector's vertices
are then `ℓ` distinct vertices, so quasi-wideness returns a separator `S`
of at most `s` vertices and a distance-`r` independent set `B` of at
least `2·s + 2` of them. Pairing the rounds that selected a vertex of `B`
off chronologically gives `s + 1` pairs, and for each the strategy's
maintained walk between the pair's two vertices, in the older round's
arena. Two ingredients replace the notes' "removed vertices are gone".
*Isolation is permanent*: arenas only lose edges, so a vertex the
strategy isolated in some round has no incident edge in any later arena.
*Distinct pairs' walks are disjoint*: a vertex of an older pair's walk
was isolated when that pair's newer round was played, while every vertex
of a newer pair's walk carries an edge in an arena from strictly after
that round. So the `s + 1` walks are pairwise disjoint and one of them
avoids `S`; rebuilding it inside `deleteVerts G S` gives a walk of length
at most `r` between two distinct members of `B`, contradicting the
independence.

The round bound is `N (2·s + 2)`, not the notes' `N (2·s + 1)`: their own
proof needs `s + 1` pairwise disjoint paths so that one avoids the
separator, which is `2·s + 2` selected rounds. See the module docstring.
