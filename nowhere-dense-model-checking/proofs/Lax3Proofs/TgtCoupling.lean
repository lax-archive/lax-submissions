**Status after the 2026-08-17 prune.** Restored after the deletion of the
algorithmic layer: its imports are `Augmentation` and Mathlib only, and its
positive half (`chainWidth`, `csrSlots_lt_chainWidth` and the in-degree
bounds below) is what any implementation of the cover phase of
`plans/nowhere-dense-model-checking/algorithm-v2.md` §6.2 has to size its
arrays against. The consumers named in the prose (`RamDriverCompose.*`,
`RamBfs`, `RamCover`, `RamScatter`, `RamBfsPaths`, `Refine.G2CostProbe`) are
deleted; read them as a record of where the question arose.

The refutation the file exists for is unaffected by the prune and is the
reason to keep it: a fraternity graph can occupy strictly more adjacency
slots than the graph it is built from, with smallest witness `K₁,₄`, so a
representation that couples a target array's length to the last offset must
widen rather than reuse.
-/

/-!
**The two `tgt` couplings, at the abstract level.**

`RamDriverCompose.orderImplements₀` is stated at `R = 0` and its header
says why: at `R > 0` "the two `tgt` couplings `OrderImplements`'s
docstring records are still open — `RamAugment.AugPre` asks for `tgt` at
the fraternity graph's own slot count while the driver's is the level's
`ns`, and nothing relates the width `W` to the in-degrees the chain
reaches."

# The reading

`OrderImplements`'s own docstring adds that the reason `AugPre` pins
`tgt` to `nf = fratSlots D` is the reasoning kit's `Csr` relation, which
couples a target array's length to the last offset; widening it "means
widening `tgt` in `RamBfs`, `RamCover`, `RamScatter` and `RamBfsPaths`
too, since all four pin it at `ns`". So the two couplings are, read as
mathematics and with every machine word removed:

* **(a) the level's slot count does not dominate the round's.** The
  driver holds one array at `ns`, the number of slots the *level's* graph
  occupies; a round needs `fratSlots D`, the number the *fraternity*
  graph occupies. The docstring's phrasing leaves open whether one is a
  bound for the other, and this file settles it: it is not, and the
  smallest witness is **K₁,₄** — a star on four leaves, oriented into its
  centre, whose fraternity graph is the complete graph on the leaves and
  occupies `12` slots against the star's `8`. Any repair therefore has to
  widen the array; none can reuse `ns`.
* **(b) what a width has to dominate is the in-degrees.** The positive
  half: `csrSlots_fratGraph_le` bounds a round's slot count by `n · d²`
  in the in-degree bound `d`, and `chainWidth` turns the in-degree budget
  of a greedy augmentation chain into a *single* width that dominates
  every round of the chain **and** the level's own graph. That is the
  fact the `R > 0` ordering phase needs in order to allocate once and
  keep `RamElim.ElimPre`'s "the call's slot count is only a lower bound"
  discipline through the fold.

Where the docstring is ambiguous — it names the couplings but does not
say in which direction they should be closed — this file states the
strongest abstract fact the text supports: (a) as a refutation of the
`ns`-dominates reading, with the concrete witness the brief names, and
(b) as a uniform width in the chain's own budget.

# The abstract vocabulary

`csrSlots F` is the number of slots a graph occupies in compressed-row
form — the abstract shadow of the driver's `ns` and of
`RamAugment.fratSlots`. `csrSlots_eq_sum_degree` is that it is the sum of
the degrees and `csrSlots_eq_two_mul` that it is twice the edge count,
which is what a `RamBfs.CsrSimple` block structure has in its target
array; the definition itself is a filter rather than
`SimpleGraph.degree` so that it computes on the witness below. Nothing in
this file mentions a machine state, an `Env` or a `Com`: the only imports
are the campaign's own orientation mathematics and mathlib.

`csrSlots (fratGraph D)` and `RamAugment.fratSlots D` are the same number
— `RamAugment.fratNbrs D v` is by `RamAugment.mem_fratNbrs` the neighbour
finset of `fratGraph D` — but that bridge is deliberately *not* proved
here, since it is one line at the consumer and proving it would drag the
`Ram*` stack into a file whose whole point is to be free of it.

# Falsification gate

The K₁,₄ witness is itself the falsification of coupling (a)'s optimistic
reading, and it is computed rather than argued (`#guard`, then the
theorems by `decide`). One more refutation is recorded: the star `K₁,₃` —
one leaf smaller — has fraternity slots `= ns` exactly, so no smaller
star refutes the coupling and `K₁,₄` is the smallest star witness. The
width arithmetic of coupling (b) is `#guard`-checked on the smallest
chain data.

/-! ### Coupling (a), refuted: `ns` is no bound

The star on four leaves, every edge oriented into the centre. The
fraternity graph is the complete graph on the four leaves — any two
leaves point at the centre — so it occupies `4 · 3 = 12` slots, against
the star's `2 · 4 = 8`. The level's array is therefore too short for the
round by a factor that grows with the degree, and no repair can reuse
it. -/

/-! ### Coupling (b): one width for the whole chain

Along a greedy augmentation chain the in-degrees follow
`Augmentation.budget`, which is monotone in the round; so the last
round's budget bounds every round's, and a single width cut to it
dominates every fraternity graph the chain materializes — and the
level's own graph too, which is the other array the ordering phase holds
at `ns`. -/

`chainWidth`'s `n · n` term exists to hold the level's own graph at the
generic `csrSlots_le_sq`; the level's graph occupies exactly `ns` slots
and every masked sub-arena's at most that, so the degree-aware width
reads `ns` and the `n · n` dies — `C0Probe.level_interface_floor_cubic`'s
`n · n ≤ W` step has no route through this width
(`Refine.G2CostProbe.width_step_dead` is the compiled instance). The
forms were designed and compiled in `Refine.G2CostProbe`; these are the
