**Wave B7's gate: two compiled findings that block the C0 discharge.**

C0 (`Lax3.ModelChecking.exists_almostLinearTime_program_modelChecking`)
hands the program a word `x` with `Lax11.GraphEncoding.EncodesGraph x n G`
*alone* and asks for cost `c · (|x| + 1) ^ (1 + ε)` at every `ε > 0`.
The brief's assembly route is `RamDriverRoot.driverRoot_decides_sentence`
(30 slots, all producered) → `Spec` → `ComputesInTime`. Both findings are
compiled against those slots verbatim, in the house style of
`Refine.CostShapeProbe` (the frozen interface's floor) and
`TgtWidenProbe` (the fold gates): the refutation is checked before any
assembly is attempted, and it is the record.

**Finding 1 — `EncodesGraph` does not produce `CsrSimple` (slot #6).**
The encoding *deliberately* permits a block to name a neighbour twice
(`Lax11.GraphEncoding`'s notes say so in words), and the root theorem's
`hcsr : RamElim.CsrSimple G ns O T` — wave D4's "data of the word" —
forbids exactly that: the two eliminations of the ordering phase read a
degree off a row, so a duplicate slot inflates a degree and the greedy
minimality the cover-degree chain stands on is about the wrong number.
`dupWord` below is a genuine `EncodesGraph` word for `K₂` whose first
row lists vertex `1` twice; `encodesGraph_not_csrSimple` is the
headline. Consequence: `CsrSimple` cannot be *assumed* at the C0
boundary, where the input predicate is `EncodesGraph` alone — the
driver needs a dedup guard between the decode and the first level
(`driverRoot = decodeCom ; driverAt 0 ; sentenceCom`, so the splice
point exists and `driver_correct`'s decode slot is already a
hypothesis), or an equivalent repair. Options are itemized in the wave
report and the plan ledger.

**Finding 2 — the landed cost interface has an `Ω(n·W)` floor, and
`W ≥ chainWidth ≥ n² + 1` at the `R = R*` the mass bound needs.**
`level_interface_floor` is proved from three hypotheses of
`driverRoot_decides_sentence` *verbatim* — `hKs` (#20), `hKo` (#22),
`hKl` (#27) — for every instantiation of every free parameter: any
level budget `Kl` those side conditions admit at `ℓ ≥ 2` pays
`n · (60·W + 1600·n) ≤ Kl 0 n`. The mechanism is the plan's own R1.6
touched-only debt surfacing at the composition: `hKo` charges the
ordering phase at *carrier* width (`orderPhaseCost n ns W =
1600·n + 1350·ns + 60·W + 650`) at **every** arena, including the empty
one, and `hKl`'s turn sum runs up to `m = n` turns each of which pays a
nested level (`turnCost` carries `Kin` additively). So even at
`W = ns` the interface floor is `1600·n²` — over C0's bound for every
`ε < 1` on sparse class members — and on the C0 cost path the width is
not `ns`: the mass bound needs `R = R* > 0` (`integration-design.md`
§2.3, compiled there), `orderImplementsR`'s `hWc` pins
`chainWidth n d D₁ R ≤ W`, and `chainWidth` carries an `n · n` term for
the level's own graph, so the floor is `60·n³`
(`level_interface_floor_cubic`). No parameter split can land that under
`c · (|x| + 1) ^ (1 + ε)`: on a sparse member `|x| ≤ 3·n + 3`, and the
`#guard` at the bottom checks `60·n³ > c · (3·n + 4)²` — the `ε = 1`
budget at a generous constant — at one large instance; `c` is chosen
before `n`, so the quantifier order does the rest.

The floor is not only in the hypothesis shapes: the *program* pays it
too — `orderCom R W j` opens with `saveCsr`, which copies `.lit W`
cells at every level entry (rebase F-c-4), and a level can be entered
`n` times per depth. That half is a paper argument, exactly as the F1
program floor was (`integration-design.md` §2.2); this file compiles
the interface shadow, which is what the assembly would have had to
consume.

Repairs (owner decisions; itemized in the wave report): block-driven
nested order/cover/base phases (R1.6/R1.8, the plan's own deferred
items) for the `1600·n²` half, and live-width (`≤ 2·n·budget`-sized)
save/restore plus a degree-aware `chainWidth` for the `60·n³` half.

/-! ### Finding 1: a duplicate-bearing `EncodesGraph` word

`dupWord` encodes `K₂` with `edgeCount = 2`: row 0 is `[1, 1]` — vertex
`1` listed twice — and row 1 is `[0, 0]`. Every clause of
`EncodesGraph` holds (`adj_iff` only *exists* a slot), and
`CsrSimple`'s `nodup` fails at row 0. -/

#guard target dupWord 1 = 1

/-- **`dupWord` is a genuine encoding of `K₂`.** Repetition is not a
defect of the word: the encoding's `adj_iff` is an existential, and the
concept's own notes state that repetitions are deliberately not
forbidden. -/

equivalent repair) before C0 can be discharged. -/

/-! ### Finding 2: the interface floor of the landed root theorem

The three hypotheses below are `driverRoot_decides_sentence`'s `hKs`,
`hKo` and `hKl`, byte for byte (`B` does not occur in them). The floor
holds for *every* instantiation of every free parameter — in
particular for every candidate discharge of C0 through the landed
theorem. -/

/-- **The carrier-width phase floor.** Any `Kl` admitted by the landed
side conditions at `ℓ ≥ 2` pays the ordering phase's carrier-width cost
on `n` turns: `n · (60·W + 1600·n) ≤ Kl 0 n`. The route: `hKl` at
`j = 1, m = 0` makes the nested level pay `orderPhaseCost n ns W` on
the *empty* arena (`hKo` is size-blind — the R1.6 debt); `hKs` makes a
turn pay its nested level (`turnCost` carries `Kin` additively); `hKl`
at `j = 0, m = t = n` runs `n` such turns (all block sizes zero, so the
mass side condition is free — the floor is not about the mass). -/
