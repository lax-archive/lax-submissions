**Status after the 2026-08-17 prune.** This file survived the deletion of the
algorithmic layer and was restored on evidence: it is Mathlib-only, and
`exists_driverCostsSigma` (below) is *already* the recursion that
`plans/nowhere-dense-model-checking/algorithm-v2.md` §7 states, with its
starred hypothesis `∑ bs c ≤ D * (m + 1)` verbatim, and
`sigma_root_almostLinear` is already the `n^(1+ε)` close. The consumers named
throughout the prose below (`RamDriverRoot.*`, `turnCost`, the `hK*` slots)
are deleted; read those names as a record of the shape the recursion was
extracted from, not as live references.

Two adjustments the redesign needed are now in the file, in the **Rev-5
recurrence** section at the bottom (2026-08-18): `exists_driverCostsSigma`
assumes each level's own charge is **linear** in the arena weight
(`hKo : Ko j m ≤ ko j * (m + 1)`), whereas the redesign's cover phase is
`a · N^(1+2δ)`; and it splits `ε` as `ε/ℓ` where Rev 5 splits it as
`ε/(ℓ+2)` — `ℓ+1` levels of recursion each spending one `δ` through (★),
plus the cover's own second `δ`. The Rev-5 section (`IsCostRecurrence`,
`cost_le_of_isCostRecurrence`, `cost_root_le`, `chosenK_step`) carries both,
with the slackened `K := c_D + 1 + A` of §3. `exists_driverCostsSigma` and
`sigma_root_almostLinear` stay exactly as landed for their consumers.

**The driver's cost recurrence, solved.**

`RamDriverRoot.driverRoot_decides_sentence` leaves the cost parameters
free and asks for them only through side conditions. Four of those —
`hKbase`, `hKl`, `hKs`, and the affine shape of `RamDriverRoot.turnCost`
in its `Kin` slot — form a single **downward affine recursion** over the
levels `j = ℓ, ℓ-1, …, 0`:

* `hKbase` : `Cbase ≤ Kl ℓ` — the base pass at the bottom level;
* `hKs`    : `tb j + Kl (j+1) ≤ Ks j` — one turn of the centre loop, whose
  cost is a per-level constant `tb j` *plus one copy* of the cost of the
  nested driver, since `turnCost` names `Kin` once and additively;
* `hKl`    : `order + (cover + ((Ks j + 8) * n + 6)) ≤ Kl j` — a level is
  the ordering phase, the cover phase, and `n` clusters each running a
  turn.

Substituting gives `Kl j ≥ a j + n · Kl (j+1)` with
`a j = order + (cover + ((tb j + 8) * n + 6))`: an affine recursion with
per-level constant `a j` and per-level coefficient `n`.

# What this file provides

Everything is **parametric**: `a`, `b` and `Cbase` are opaque, and no
engine cost, no `Ram*` file and no numeral of the current engines is
mentioned anywhere. The tower-synthesized costs are plugged in later by
choosing `a`, `b`, `Cbase`.

* `solve a b Cbase ℓ` — the canonical downward solution, defined by
  structural recursion on the *fuel* `ℓ - j` so that it computes.
* `Cbase_le_solve` / `le_solve_succ` — it satisfies the recursion
  constraints (with `≤`, the direction the side conditions want; the
  underlying identity `solve_step` is an equality).
* `solve_le_of_le` — it is the **least** such solution: any `K`
  satisfying the same constraints dominates it pointwise. This is what
  makes "instantiate with `solve`" lossless.
* `solve_eq_closed` — the closed form
  `solve a b Cbase ℓ 0 = (∑ j < ℓ, a j * ∏ i < j, b i) + Cbase * ∏ i < ℓ, b i`.
* `solve_mono` — monotone in `a`, `b` and `Cbase` separately and jointly.
* `solve_const` / `solve_const_le` — the constant-coefficient case
  `b ≡ β`, where the products collapse to `β ^ j`, and the coarse
  geometric bound `(ℓ · A + Cbase) · β ^ ℓ`.
* `exists_driverCosts` — the corollary in the driver's own shape: from
  `ℓ`, `n`, the two phase costs and the per-level turn constants `tb`,
  a pair `Kl`, `Ks` satisfying `hKbase`, `hKs` and `hKl` verbatim, with
  `Kl 0` in closed form. Stated with `tb` opaque and with the
  `turnCost`-in-`Kin` affinity as the hypothesis `hturn`, so that no
  `Ram*` import is needed here: P4 supplies `tb j := turnCost … 0` and
  the (definitional) affinity.

# Falsification gate

The recursion, the closed form, the minimality and the driver shape are
`#guard`-checked on `ℓ = 0, 1, 2, 3` with tiny coefficients before any
proof, and three plausible-but-false readings are refuted the same way —
dropping the coefficient products, charging the base at the wrong power,
and reading the solution as monotone in the level. See the
`Falsification` section.

The corollary `RamDriverRoot.driverRoot_decides_sentence` consumes: the
three side conditions `hKbase`, `hKs`, `hKl` at once, with witnesses.
Nothing here knows what the numbers are — `order`, `cover`, `Cbase` and
the per-level turn constants `tb` are opaque, and the only thing assumed
about the turn cost is that it is **affine with coefficient one** in the
nested driver's cost, which is what `turnCost`'s text says (`Kin` occurs
once, additively). -/

`ℓ`, the carrier size `n`, the two phase costs, the base cost and the

cost side conditions of `driverRoot_decides_sentence` — `hKbase`, `hKs`,
`hKl` — with `Kl 0` in closed form, and `Kl` least among all such.

`turn j Kin` is the turn cost with the nested driver's budget in its
`Kin` slot; `hturn` is its affinity, which for `RamDriverRoot.turnCost`
holds with `tb j := turnCost … j φ (Ksc j) 0` by `Nat.add` associativity

/-! ### The Σ shape

`integration-design.md` §5.9. The uniform corollary above charges a
level `n` turns at the worst turn's budget, which forces the
coefficient `n` and hence the `n ^ ℓ` floor its §2.1 compiles. The
revised interface charges a level the **sum** of its turns, each read at
its own block size, and every cost becomes a function of the arena size
`m`:

* `Kl j m` — the level at depth `j` on an arena of `m` alive vertices;
* `Kt j s` — one turn whose block has `s` members;
* `Ko j m`, `Kc j m` — the ordering and cover phases, active-set driven,
  so linear in the arena rather than in the carrier;
* `tb j s` — the turn's own leaves, touched-only, linear in the block.

The three shape hypotheses `hKo`/`hKc`/`htb` are exactly "linear in the
size handed in" (`… ≤ coeff * (size + 1)`, the `+1` absorbing the
per-call constants), and the mass hypothesis of the level is the one
B6 supplies from the cover's degree bound: the block sizes of a level
sum to at most `D * (m + 1)`.

Under those, the linear ansatz `Kl j m = u j * (m + 1)` turns the level
condition into the *same* affine recursion the file already solves —
with the coefficient `D + 1` in place of `n`:

```
u j = (ko j + kc j + α j * (D + 1) + 14) + (D + 1) * u (j + 1)
```

The `+ 1` in the coefficient is not slack: the level pays one turn
*overhead* per nonempty block on top of the block's own mass, and there
can be `m` of them. The falsification block below compiles that — the
side condition is refuted at coefficient `D`. -/

/-- The per-level constant of the Σ-shaped recursion: the two phase
coefficients, the turn-leaf coefficient charged at the mass

From the level count `ℓ`, the mass coefficient `D`, the base

`α` bounding the two phases and the turn's leaves linearly in the size
they are handed, there are size-indexed `Kl` and `Kt` satisfying the
revised side conditions of `driverRoot_decides_sentence` — the base,
the monotonicity `hKmono` the descend clause needs, the turn condition
§5.7 and the Σ-shaped level condition §5.6 — with `Kl 0` in closed form
and `Kl` least among the solutions of the induced numeric recursion.

Nothing here knows what the numbers are: `Ko`, `Kc`, `tb` and `turn`
are opaque, and the only thing assumed about the turn cost is the same
affinity in the nested driver's slot that `exists_driverCosts` assumes,
now at each block size. The uniform corollary above is unchanged and
stays: this is its refinement, not its replacement. -/

/-! ### The real exponent

The last step of P4: the mass coefficient `exists_cover_degree` hands
over is `D = ⌈c · n ^ (ε / ℓ)⌉₊`, and the recursion charges it `ℓ`
times, so the headline needs `(D + 1) ^ ℓ ≤ c' · n ^ ε`. That is the
same massage `CoverDegree.exists_cover_degree` performs internally on
`X ^ (2 · 16 ^ R) = m ^ δ`, at the driver's exponent.

Both hypotheses are necessary, not decoration: at `n = 0` the right
side is `0` while the left is at least `1` (`ceil_rpow_pow_zero`
compiles the refutation), and at `ℓ = 0` the `X ^ ℓ = n ^ ε` step is
false. Everything is stated at `ℝ` — `^ ε` is `Real.rpow`, `^ ℓ` is
the monoid power — with the ℕ-side consumer taking the cast form. -/

/-- **The exponent massage.** With `X = n ^ (ε / ℓ)` at least one, the
ceiling costs at most one and the `+ 1` one more, so the whole
`ℓ`-th power collapses to `(c + 2) ^ ℓ · n ^ ε`. -/

/-! ### The Rev-5 recurrence: `a·N^(1+2δ)` cover charge, slack `K`, `ε/(ℓ+2)` split

`algorithm-v2.md` §7, the ⟨C⟩ Rev-5 form (2026-08-17).  Per node at
depth `j < ℓ` with arena size `N ≥ 1`,

```
T j N ≤ a·N^(1+2δ) + c·Σ_u N_u + Σ_u T (j+1) N_u,
(★)  Σ_u N_u ≤ (c_D + 1)·N^(1+δ),   1 ≤ N_u ≤ N,
```

and at the bottom the leaf is charged `T ℓ N ≤ c·N`.  The claim is
`T j N ≤ K^(L+1)·N^(1+(L+2)δ)` with `L = ℓ - j`, by downward induction:
the recursion term spends one `δ` through `(★)` and picks up `(c_D+1)`,
the children and cover terms are absorbed at the same exponent, and the
step closes iff `K^L·(c_D+1) + A ≤ K^(L+1)` with `A = a + c·(c_D+1)` —
which §3's *choice* `K := c_D + 1 + A` satisfies at every `L` with
nothing left to check (`chosenK_step`; at `L = 0` it is an equality,
so no side condition on any constant can hide in it).

The standing hypotheses are `1 ≤ N`, `c_D ≤ c`, and nonnegativity of
`a`, `c_D`, `δ` — **there is no lower bound on `c`** — and the ceiling's
`+1` is carried inside `(★)`'s constant `c_D + 1`, never dropped.  Every
constant is quantified before the arena: `a`, `c`, `c_D`, `δ`, `K` are
fixed by the statement before `N` is mentioned.

There are `ℓ+2` levels of exponent to divide `ε` among — `ℓ+1` levels of
recursion each spending one `δ` through `(★)`, plus the cover's own
second `δ` — so the root corollary reads `δ = ε/(ℓ+2)` and concludes
`T 0 n ≤ K^(ℓ+1)·n^(1+ε)` (`cost_root_le`), on the honest cast
`(n : ℝ) ^ (1 + ε)` itself: the induction runs entirely on `1 ≤ N`, so
no `n + 1` padding is needed anywhere.

This section *amends* the Σ shape above, it does not replace it:
`exists_driverCostsSigma` charges a level linearly in its arena and
`sigma_root_almostLinear` splits `ε` as `ε/ℓ`; both stay exactly as
landed.  Here the per-node charge is the honest cover exponent
`a·N^(1+2δ)` — the `steps ≤ f·m^(1+2δ)` shape of
`CoverSpec.IsCoverOrdering.time`, same `δ`, same exponent — and the
bridge lemma at the end connects `(★)` to
`CoverEdgeSum.sum_clusterWeight_le_rpow`, whose conclusion is `(★)`'s
edge-inclusive form. -/

/-- **The Rev-5 node recurrence** (`algorithm-v2.md` §7).  An abstract
cost `T : ℕ → ℕ → ℝ` (depth, arena size) satisfies it when the leaf
level is charged linearly (`leaf`) and every node above the leaf level
exhibits child arenas `Nu 0, …, Nu (t-1)` — each nonempty and no larger
than the node's own arena — whose total mass obeys `(★)` with the
ceiling's `+1` inside the constant `c_D + 1`, such that the node's cost
is at most cover charge + children charge + recursive charge (`node`).

A caller with concrete per-node data discharges `node` by handing over
that node's actual child list, reindexed over `range t`; empty children
are not recursed on (the recursion never runs on an empty arena), so
they are dropped before the count `t` is taken — dropping them only
lowers both sides. -/

/-- **The downward induction, solved and slackened** (§7's Claim).  Any
cost satisfying the Rev-5 recurrence is bounded at every level by
`K^(L+1) · N^(1+(L+2)δ)`, `L = ℓ - j`, for **any** `K` satisfying the
step condition `K^L·(c_D+1) + (a + c·(c_D+1)) ≤ K^(L+1)` at every `L`.
The only hypotheses beyond the step condition are `c_D ≤ c` and
nonnegativity of `a`, `c_D`, `δ`; there is no lower bound on `c`, and
`c ≤ K` and `1 ≤ K` are *derived* from the step condition at `L = 0`. -/

/-! #### The bridge to `(★)` as the cover supplies it

`IsCostRecurrence.node` asks for the child masses in the abstract range
shape `∑ u ∈ range t, Nu u ≤ (c_D + 1) · N^(1+δ)`.  E9's concrete masses
are the cluster weights of a cover of degree `⌈c_D · N^δ⌉₊`, and
`CoverEdgeSum.sum_clusterWeight_le_rpow` bounds their `Fin`-indexed sum
by `(c_D + 1) · ‖A‖^(1+δ)`.  `star_of_cover_degree` reindexes that over
`range` and adds the per-child cap `‖A[X u]‖ ≤ ‖A‖`, which is exactly
what `node`'s `Nu u ≤ N` clause wants at arena `N = ‖A‖`.  The `1 ≤ Nu u`
half is the caller's: the recursion is only ever run on the nonempty
clusters, and dropping empty ones only lowers both sides of `node`. -/
