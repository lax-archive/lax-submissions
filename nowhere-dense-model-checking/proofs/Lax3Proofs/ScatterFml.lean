Correctness of `Lax3.NormalForm.scatterFml`, the source's scatter
sentence written out in distance logic, under the maximum-size scatter
choice: `sat_scatterFml` says that

    Sat G col Fin.elim0 (scatterFml r t β) ↔
      ScatterSentence.Sat maxChoice G col ⟨r, β, t⟩,

with no rank and no locality hypothesis. Both readings say "some
`r`-scattered set of `t` vertices satisfies `β`" — the left one by
quantifying `t` vertices and writing the pairwise distance conditions and
the `t` placements of `β` as a conjunction, the right one by comparing
`t` with the largest size of an `r`-scattered subset of the set `β`
defines. Everything in between is bookkeeping: `Fin.snoc` for the
quantifier block, list membership for the conjunction, and `Set.ncard`
arithmetic against `sSup` for the two counting directions.

The placement of `β` at the `i`-th bound variable is a `rename`, and the
guard-set surface of `Lax3.DistFO` makes `sat_rename` unconditional, so
no side condition on `β` enters — in particular the theorem holds for a
`β` with local quantifiers, whose guards keep naming the one variable
they named before the placement.

The file also carries the three side conditions the `normalForm`
assembly must produce for each scatter sentence it emits, all read off
the distance rank of the sentence: `drank_succ_pred_of_drank`
(`β` has distance rank `(k+1, q−1)`), `r_le_rhoMinus_of_drank` (the
radius stays below ρ⁻(k, q), the high end of the source's radius window
climbed back along the antidiagonal) and
`semanticallyLocal_div_four_of_drank` (`β` is semantically `r/4`-local,
the low end of the window fed to `Lax3Proofs.SemLocal`).

No concept-side definition is handed to a tactic here: `verum`, `conj`,
`exUs`, `scatterFml`, `Sat`, `ScatterSentence.Sat`, `ScatterChoice.size`,
`maxChoice`, `SemanticallyLocal` and the rest are taken apart through the
`rfl`-lemmas of the unfolding section, as in `Lax3Proofs.SyntaxLemmas`.
Radius inequalities go through `Lax3Proofs.Horizon`; nothing here unfolds
`9 ^ _`.

/-! ### The maximum-size scatter choice

`Lax3.ScatterSentences.ScatterChoice` is a parameter of the concept
surface: every statement about scatter sentences holds for every choice,
and the surface names none. The source's "maximum size" choice is a
construction, so it lives here, next to the theory that consumes it; the
greedy choice is `Lax3Proofs.ScatterChoices.greedyChoice`. -/

/-- The source's "maximum size" choice: the largest cardinality of an
`r`-scattered subset of `X`. A subset of that size is inclusion-wise
maximal, since no scattered set can properly contain it. -/

/-! ### Unfolding the concept-side definitions

One `rfl`-lemma per clause of each concept-side definition this file
takes apart, exactly as in the unfolding section of
`Lax3Proofs.SyntaxLemmas` and for the same reason: a tactic handed one of
these definitions would manufacture its match splitters and record them
under the concept's namespace.

/-! ### Correctness of the written-out scatter sentence -/

/-- **The written-out scatter sentence is the scatter sentence.** Under
the maximum-size scatter choice, the sentence "there are `t` vertices,
pairwise at distance larger than `r`, all satisfying `β`" of
`Lax3.NormalForm.scatterFml` holds exactly when the scatter sentence
`⟨r, β, t⟩` does. This is the step from the locality theorem to the
normal form: with the maximum-size choice the scatter value is definable
in the logic itself.

Forward, the `t` witnesses form an `r`-scattered subset of the set `β`
defines — they are pairwise farther than `r` apart, hence in particular
distinct — of size exactly `t`, so the supremum is at least `t`.
Backward, the supremum is attained over `Fin n`, so a scattered subset of
size at least `t` exists; any `t` of its elements enumerate a satisfying
environment. -/

lemmas below climb that witness back to the rank `(k, q)` at which the
