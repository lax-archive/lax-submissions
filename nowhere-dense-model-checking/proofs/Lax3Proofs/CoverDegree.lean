What the cover the program computes costs: the analysis capstone of the
cover phase, in the vocabulary the driver's cost accounting cites.

# The three deliverables

The pieces the earlier files leave are a recursion, a composition and a
counting statement, each stated over data rather than over an optimal
choice.  This file closes them into three numbers.

*The budget.*  `AugmentedDensity.joint` is the joint in-degree/density
recursion a greedy chain runs; `joint_fst_le` reads its first component
in closed form, `(d + D₁ + 2) ^ 16 ^ i`, so that no consumer has to
unfold the recursion.  The starting in-degree is bounded the same way:
a graph whose depth-1 minors are sparse has a vertex of small degree
inside every set (`lowDegreeVertices_of_densityAtMost`), and the greedy
guarantee of the elimination engine turns that into `d₀ ≤ 2 · D₁`
(`inDeg_zero_le`).

*The cover.*  `exists_cover_degree` is the end-to-end statement: on a
nowhere dense class, for every cover radius, every number of
augmentation rounds and every `δ > 0` there is a constant `c` such that
the cover the program computes — the fibers of weak `2r`-reachability
under the ordering of its last elimination pass — is an `r`-neighborhood
cover of degree at most `⌈c · m ^ δ⌉`.  Its hypotheses are exactly the
postconditions of the two engines: an augmentation chain whose rounds
orient their fraternity graphs greedily, and two greedy eliminations,
one at the start and one at the end, each delivering an in-degree or
back-degree bound together with the guarantee that it is at most every
bound a `LowDegreeVertices` argument can prove.  Nothing about `d₀` or
about the density of `G` is assumed: both are supplied from nowhere
denseness inside the proof.

*The mass.*  `sum_ncard_le_mul` is the double count that turns a degree
bound into a bound on the total size of all clusters, which is what the
driver charges its per-cluster work against: a family of sets in which
no vertex lies in more than `d` members has total size at most `m · d`.

# The arithmetic

The budget grows by squaring at every round, so the closed bound is a
tower in the number of rounds and the theorem is stated for a fixed
round count `R`, with the constant `c` allowed to depend on it — the
quantifier shape of `AugmentedDensity.exists_chain_density`.  The final
composition picks the inner exponent `δ / (2 · 16 ^ R)` so that the
`2 · 16 ^ R`-th power the two squarings cost lands on the requested
`δ`; everything else is a constant factor absorbed into `c`.

/-! ### The budget in closed form

`joint` squares its first component at every round and feeds it into an
exponent of the density budget, so both components are bounded by powers
of the single number `d + D₁ + 2`: the in-degree budget by its
`16 ^ i`-th power, the depth-`a` density budget by its
`2 · 16 ^ i · (a + 1)`-th.  The two halves have to be carried together —
the in-degree of a round is charged the density of the previous one. -/

/-- **The joint budget, in closed form.**  Both components of the
recursion of a greedy chain are powers of `d + D₁ + 2`: the in-degree
budget of round `i` is at most its `16 ^ i`-th power, and the depth-`a`
density budget of round `i` at most its `2 · 16 ^ i · (a + 1)`-th.

# Proof

Induction on `i`, carrying both halves.  At the successor the density
budget is `(b + 2) ^ (6a + 6)` times the previous density budget at
depth `4a + 4`, and `b + 2 ≤ (d + D₁ + 2) ^ (16 ^ i + 1)` because the
base is at least `2`; the exponents add up to at most
`2 · 16 ^ (i+1) · (a + 1)`.  The in-degree budget is a sum of four
terms, each at most the `5 · 16 ^ i`-th power, and `4` is at most the
square of the base. -/

/-! ### Small degree from density

The plain-graph companion of `OrderedCovers.lowDegreeVertices_toGraph`,
which reads the same conclusion off an orientation: what a *density*
bound gives is that the subgraph induced on any vertex set — a depth-1
minor of the graph, with singleton branch sets — has few edges, hence a
vertex of small degree.  This is what the greedy pass at round zero is
measured against. -/

/-- The ordered pairs of adjacent vertices inside `S` number at most
`2 · D₁ · |S|` when every depth-1 minor on `k` vertices has at most
`D₁ · k` edges: the subgraph induced on `S` is such a minor, and its
edges each carry two ordered pairs. -/

/-! ### The end-to-end theorem -/

/--
**The degree of the computed cover.**  Fix a nowhere dense class `C`, a
cover radius `rc`, a number of augmentation rounds `R` with a `t`
satisfying the radius arithmetic `3 · t ≤ R` and `2 · rc ≤ 2 ^ t`, and
a `δ > 0`.  Then there is a constant `c` — depending on the class, on
`R` and on `δ`, not on the graph — such that on every subgraph `G` of a
member, on `m` vertices:

given an `R`-round augmentation chain of `G` whose rounds orient their
fraternity graphs greedily, a starting in-degree `d₀` that is at most
every bound a `LowDegreeVertices` argument proves of `G`, and a final
vertex ordering `π` under which the last round's graph has back-degrees
at most `k`, again with `k` at most every such bound,

the fibers of weak `2 · rc`-reachability under `π` form an
`rc`-neighborhood cover of `G` of radius `2 · rc` and degree at most
`⌈c · m ^ δ⌉`.

# What supplies the hypotheses

All of them are postconditions of the two engines and nothing else.
The chain and the greedy rounds come from the augmentation pass
(`AugStep` per round plus a greedy fraternal round); `d₀` and its
minimality, and `k` and its minimality, are the in-degree and
back-degree bounds of the two elimination passes together with the
greedy guarantee `∀ k', LowDegreeVertices _ k' → k ≤ k'` of `ElimPost`;
`π` is the permutation the rank array of the last pass defines.  Nothing is assumed about the density of `G` or
about the size of `d₀`: both come from nowhere denseness inside.

# Proof

`AugmentedDensity.exists_densityAtMost_of_nowhereDense` at depth
`chainDepth R 1` and exponent `δ / (2 · 16 ^ R)` gives a depth-1 density
`D₁ = ⌈c₀ · m ^ (δ / (2 · 16 ^ R))⌉` of `G`.  That bounds `d₀` by
`2 · D₁` (`inDeg_zero_le`), and then
`AugmentedDensity.greedy_chain_joint_inDegLE` bounds the in-degree of
the last round by `(joint d₀ D₁ R).1`, and the greedy guarantee of the
final pass bounds `k` by twice that
(`OrderedCovers.lowDegreeVertices_toGraph`).
`OrderedCovers.isNeighborhoodCover_of_augChain` produces the cover with
degree `(d + 1) · (k + 1)`, which `degree_le_of_budget` closes into
`6 · (3 · D₁ + 2) ^ (2 · 16 ^ R)`.  Since `D₁ ≤ c₀ · m ^ δ' + 1` and
`m ^ δ' ≥ 1`, that is at most `6 · (3 c₀ + 5) ^ (2 · 16 ^ R) · m ^ δ`:
the inner exponent was chosen so that its `2 · 16 ^ R`-th power is the
requested one.

/-! ### The ordering property, as a phase postcondition (rebase B5)

The Σ-interface's `OrderImplements` carries a parametric predicate
`P π ord` on the ordering the phase produces
(`integration-design.md` §5.4), and the `R = R*` phase discharges it at

    P π _ := ∀ v, (wreach G π (2 · rc) v).ncard ≤ ⌈c · m ^ δ⌉₊

— the exact hypothesis a cover pass along `ord` consumes, so that the
cover the *next* phase builds along `ord` has the
subpolynomial degree the mass accounting stands on.

`exists_wreach_degree` is that discharge in one step: it is
`exists_cover_degree` with the cover projected away — the fibers of the
produced cover at `v` *are* `wreach G π (2·rc) v`, so the cover's
`degree_le` field is the predicate verbatim.  Its hypotheses are
unchanged: all of them are postconditions of the two engines on the
`R*`-chain (the chain and the greedy rounds from the augmentation
rounds' `AugPost`, `d₀` and its minimality from the first elimination's
`ElimPost`, `k` and its minimality from the final elimination — which
the `R*` phase runs on the *symmetrized augmented graph*
`(D R).toGraph`, not on the level's own graph; see the B5 report).

The fibre identity `wreach_fibre_eq` is the one authored step, and its
variance is the refutable content: see the falsification block. -/

/-- **The fibers of the wreach cover are the wreach sets.**  The cluster
family `X u = {w | u ∈ wreach G π r w}` of `isNeighborhoodCover_wreach`
has, at each `v`, exactly `wreach G π r v` as the set of clusters
containing `v`. -/

/-! ### The bundle the `R*` phase exports (rebase F-c-2)

`exists_wreach_degree`'s six machine hypotheses are exactly the data an
`R`-round ordering phase produces, and they are produced in three
places: the fold (the chain and the per-round greedy property), the
phase's *first* elimination (`d₀` and its minimality, off `ElimPost` at
the level's own arena) and its *last* (`k` and its minimality, off
`ElimPost` at the **symmetrized augmented** graph — which is why an
implementation needs a symmetrization pass at all).

`AugChainData` names that list once, so that the phase obligation's
parametric slot `P` has a value with a name rather than a six-clause
conjunction written out at every call site, and so that the wave which
proves the phase and the wave which consumes it agree on the interface
without either reading the other's file. `wreach_degree_of_data` is the
consumption: the bundle plus the class mathematics is the predicate a
cover pass takes.

Nothing here is new mathematics — it is `exists_wreach_degree` with its
hypotheses named — and that is the point: the `R*` phase's
postcondition is now a *definition* this file owns. -/

/-- **The degree data of an `R`-round greedy chain**: the chain, the
per-round greedy property, and the two elimination bounds with their
minimalities. This is `exists_wreach_degree`'s hypothesis list, verbatim

to the level's own two elimination bounds and carries nothing about
augmentation. That is exactly why an `R = 0` ordering phase can only
instantiate its postcondition at `True` while the `R*` phase cannot:
the content of the slot is the fold, and the fold at `R = 0` is a
no-op. -/

/-! ### Falsification (B5)

The authored content of the projection is the *variance* of the fibre
identity: the clusters containing `v` are indexed by `wreach … v`
itself, i.e. the fibre of the family `X u = {w | u ∈ R w}` at `v` is
`R v` — **not** `{u | v ∈ R u}`, which is what a reader of
`u ∈ wreach G π r w` gets by transposing the two binders.  The two
readings agree on symmetric families, so the control below separates
them on the smallest asymmetric one. -/
