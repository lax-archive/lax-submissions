The first slice of the walk-distance API of `Lax3.ColoredGraphs`:
`WithinDist` is reflexive, symmetric and additively transitive, it grows
with the radius and with the graph, and it descends along Lax199508's
`deleteVerts` — the isolation move that this submission's splitter game
and its rewriting step both perform.

The load-bearing statement is `withinDist_deleteVerts_or_through`: a
walk of length at most `d` either avoids an isolated set `S` altogether,
in which case every one of its edges survives isolation, or it meets `S`
somewhere and splits there into two walks whose lengths add up to at
most `d`. That is the `≥` half of the metric identity

    dist G u v = min (dist (deleteVerts G S) u v) (min over s ∈ S of
                      dist G u s + dist G s v)

which the isolation rewrite reduces to; the `≤` half is
`withinDist_deleteVerts` together with `withinDist_trans`. Endpoints in
`S` and walks of length zero need no separate treatment: the split point
is taken anywhere in the support, so `u ∈ S` splits a walk into an empty
prefix and the walk itself.

/-- The decomposition the isolation rewrite runs on: a walk of length at
most `d` either avoids the isolated set `S`, and then survives isolation
whole, or it passes through some `s ∈ S`, and then splits at `s` into
two walks whose lengths add up to at most `d`. -/
