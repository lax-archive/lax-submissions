/-!
The cluster step and the level of `Lax3Proofs.RamDriver`, discharged.

This file is stage two of the driver: the two largest of the driver's
obligations — `RamDriver.ClusterStepImplements`, the turn of the loop
over the centres, and `RamDriver.LevelImplements`, the loop itself —
proved from the flat passes this file walks and from the semantic glue
`Lax3Proofs.RamDriver` already carries.

# The flat passes

`RamDriver.fillUpto` is the kit's array pass with a cell expression, so
a pass over the carrier is one application of `Fill.loop_spec` — except
that the driver's passes *read* arrays (`copyCom` reads the source,
`andCom` and `subCom` read two masks) and the kit's phase says nothing
about arrays it does not write. `fill_spec` is that gap closed once: the
same pass, with a list of arrays the caller declares frozen, which the
pass may read in its cell expression and which come back unchanged.
`fillCom_spec`, `copyCom_spec`, `andCom_spec` and `subCom_spec` are the
driver's four passes as instances of it, and `masked_mul` is what the
third of them is worth — the `andCom` half of `RamDriver.masked_step`.

# Neighbourhood expansion

The driver measures a distance profile by expanding a set `cap` times
rather than by searching. `nbhd` is one step of that and `ballOf` is the
result of `r` of them; `ballOf_zero` and `nbhd_ballOf` are the two
equations a chain of expansions is proved by, and `ballOf_singleton` is
the form `Evaluator.isoColoring_slotPd` reads a ball in.

`RamDriver.expandCom`'s own walk is two nested loops. The shared
primitives `expandVal` and `hit_eq_expandVal` live above the driver in
`Refine.DriverPrelude`; this file supplies the remaining mathematics and
invariants: `markSet_expandVal` says that the mask left by one step marks
exactly `nbhd` of what the source marks, and `ExpandInv` and `ScanHit`
are what the outer and inner loops carry. What is left is the symbolic
execution between them.

# What enters as a hypothesis, and why

The driver's own obligation `ClusterStepImplements` is a single `Prop`
about a program with seven phases (wave R1.8-T2 added the kill pass), of
which one — the nested driver — is the obligation's own hypothesis. The
other six enter as named `Prop`s of this file — `DescendStep`,
`EnumStep`, `ColourStep`, `KillStep`, `ScatterStep`
and `ReadbackStep` — in the manner of the driver's own obligations: each
is a self-contained Hoare triple over the program text, and each names
in its docstring the specification that discharges it.

`clusterStepImplements` composes them with the driver's `masked_step`,
`stepArenaP_eq`, `exists_pad_enum` and `sat_iff_eval_step`, and *all* of
the mathematics of the cluster step is here: what the six are left
owing is what their arrays hold, never what it means. `ReadbackStep` is
`RamDriver.ReadbackImplements` with its valuation indexed by the vertex
the readback stands on, which that obligation's is not — a local atom's
truth varies from vertex to vertex, and the driver's version evaluates
it at whatever the scalar `z` held before the loop started.

Two frames are needed that no syntax can supply, because both commands
contain the nested driver, which is a variable. `InnerFrames` says the
nested call leaves the depth it was called from alone; `ClusterFrames`
says a turn of the centre loop leaves the other clusters' table cells —
and the cover's three answers — alone, which
`RamDriver.ClusterStepImplements`'s postcondition does not. Each is
stated as a second specification of the same command at the same
precondition, and `spec_conj` merges it with the driver's obligation
into one: the semantics is deterministic, so two specifications of one
command speak about one final state.

/-! ### Two specifications of one command

`Spec` is an existential over the final state, so two specifications of
the same command from the same precondition name two states — and the
semantics is deterministic, so they are the same state. That is what
lets a caller take a phase's meaning from one lemma and its frame from
another without walking the program twice. -/

/-! ### The flat passes

`RamDriver.fillUpto a (.var m) e` is the kit's array pass, and
`Fill.loop_spec` is its whole content — for a cell expression that reads
nothing. The driver's passes read: `copyCom` reads its source, `andCom`
and `subCom` read two masks apiece. So the pass is restated with a list
of arrays the caller declares frozen; they may occur in the cell
expression, they are not written, and they come back. -/

their cell functions. -/

/-- **A flat pass with frozen readers.** `x := 0; while x < m do (a[x]
:= e; x := x + 1)` at the counter name the driver uses, with a family of
arrays the pass may read. What is asked of the cell expression is what
`Fill.loop_spec` asks — that it evaluates to what `F` says about the
cell the counter names — but now in the presence of the frozen family,
which is what makes a copy or a mask operation expressible. -/

The driver measures every distance profile of a cluster step by
expanding a set one step at a time, `cap` times, rather than by
searching: the radius is a construction-time constant and one step is a
flat pass over the block structure. What the pass computes is `nbhd`,
and what the chain of them computes is `ballOf` — the metric statement
`Evaluator.isoColoring`'s slot equations are phrased in. -/

/-! ### One step of neighbourhood expansion, as a walk

`RamDriver.expandCom` is two nested loops: a flat pass over the carrier,
and inside it, for a live vertex, a scan of its block. The outer one is
a fill of the destination mask with `expandVal`, so `Spec.forRangeZero`
owns it and `Fill.Below` is what it carries; the inner one is
`Csr.rowScan_spec`, and what *it* carries is that the hit flag records
whether a live marked neighbour has been seen among the slots passed so
far. -/

/-- The state one pass of the expansion carries: the destination filled
up to the counter, and everything it reads.

**The target array is the level's allocation width** (rebase F-c-4):

`RamCover.CoverPost` is an existential over the arrays it left; a loop
whose turns all read the same answers wants them named once, and that is
what `CoverHeld` is. `coverPost_of_held` puts them back into the form
the driver's obligations ask for. -/

/-- The cover's three answers, named — at the *depth's own* names, which
`RamDriver.coverSave` copied them into. A nested level takes a cover of
its own, so the fixed names `xoff`, `xmem`, `asg` and `xp` hold another
level's answers by the time the enclosing turn's readback runs; these do
not. -/

/-! ### The six sub-walks of one cluster

`RamDriver.ClusterStepImplements`'s docstring splits the turn into seven
passes, of which one — the nested driver — is the obligation's own
hypothesis. The other six are the `Prop`s of this section, each a
self-contained Hoare triple over the program text and each naming, in
its docstring, what discharges it. Nothing of the *mathematics* of the
cluster step is in them: what they say their arrays hold is stated in
the terms `RamDriver.masked_step`, `RamDriver.stepArenaP_eq`,
`RamDriver.exists_pad_enum` and `Evaluator.isoColoring`'s three slot
equations put those arrays in, and turning that into satisfaction is
`clusterStepImplements`'s business below. -/

section Cluster

/-- What the descent leaves: the cluster, the batch, the
cluster-restricted mask and the two masks of the next depth, each named
with what it is worth.

**The mask of the next depth is pinned pointwise** (wave R1.8-T1, design
§2.4). The graph equation `masked G Alv' = deleteVerts (deleteVerts _ Xᶜ) W`
is blind to the mask *value* at a vertex with no edges — that is finding
B8/1 (`Refine.DeadRow.descent_mask_not_pointwise_monotone`) — so the
clause after it says which cells the stored array holds nonzero: exactly
the alive vertices of the cluster outside the batch. It is not a new
obligation on the program but a reading of what it already computes: the
array is the cell function `Alv' k = M k * Xa k * (1 - Wa k)` of
`RamDriver.masked_step`, whose proof derives this very equivalence on the
way to the graph equation (`RamDriverDescend.mask_cell_ne_zero` names it,
and `RamDriverDescend.descendStep` exports it for the array it stored).
Two consumers need the *set* and not the graph: the kill pass's
postcondition, which writes a row for every vertex of `X ∩ alive ∩ Wᶜ`
that the child mask kills, and the level induction's no-resurrection step
(a vertex dead at depth `j` is dead at depth `j + 1`, which follows by
`M v = 0` refuting the left conjunct). -/

/-- The same with the padded enumeration the batch was read into.

**The buffer is not here** (wave E2). `RamDriver.enumBatch` writes the
padded enumeration into the *fixed* name `"wa"`, and a nested level runs
a padding of its own, so no clause about `"wa"` can cross the nested
call: `ClusterFrames` would have to ask the driver at depth `j + 1` not
to write it, and the driver does. The buffer is live between the padding
and the colouring and nowhere else — the scatter phase and the readback
read the depth-`(j+1)` tables and the cluster's masks, never the
enumeration — so it is `ClusterWa` below, a conjunct of `EnumStep`'s
postcondition and of `ColourStep`'s precondition, and of nothing that
straddles the recursion.

**The enumeration is the batch's CLUSTER half** (wave R1.8-T3-flip
(c2a)). `RamDriver.enumBatch` guards on the cluster indicator as well as
the batch's, so the buffer's range is `W ∩ X` and not `W`. The batch as
a set is untouched — it is `BatchData`'s `W` above, and it is the game
invariant's, the child mask's and the kill set's, all unchanged — and
the cluster step's arena cannot tell the two apart
(`RamDriver.deleteVerts_inter_cluster`, which is what `masked_alv_eq`
below now runs through). What the narrowing buys is `mem_cluster`: every
entry of the padded enumeration lies in the cluster, which is
`Refine.DeadRowProbe.stepColoringP_subset`'s `hw` — the hypothesis the
whole outside-class story of the atom pass rides on, and the one nothing
in the turn used to supply
(`Refine.ScatterDeadPass.outside_class_not_uniform_refuted`). -/

/-- **The descent.** That `RamDriver.descendCom` writes the cluster
indicator, the ball, the batch and the two masks of the next depth.

Its content is the two mask equations of the driver's docstring. The
work mask is `RamDriver.masked_step` at the cluster's indicator and the
batch's, which is why the postcondition below names the arena the mask
cuts out as `deleteVerts (deleteVerts _ Xᶜ) W` and not as an array; the
cluster-restricted mask `resName j` is the same lemma with the batch
dropped, which is `masked_mul` above. That the cluster holds the
`cap`-ball of every vertex it was assigned is
`RamCover.CoverOut.asg_cover` read through `RamCover.CoverOut.block`,
which is what `clusterLoad` materializes. The batch's two size facts —
that it is nonempty and has at most `mb` vertices — are the program's
own: it contains the connector because `batchCom` stores a `1` there
before anything else, and it has at most one connector plus one walk
buffer of `2·cap + 1` cells per earlier round, which is `mb` because
`mb` is `ℓ · (2·cap + 1)`. The expansion chain that builds the ball is
`RamDriver.expandCom` iterated `2·cap` times.

**The last clause is the splitter game's.** The pass is the only one of
the six that moves the *game* arena — `gamName j` to `gamName (j + 1)`,
by the ball of the round and the batch — so it is the only one that can
say the play went on: at a node whose recorded rounds reach a game arena
the connector still has an edge in, the round extends by the batch the
program marked; at one where it does not, the round leaves nothing and
so does the cluster step. That disjunction is `RamDriver.playRec_succ`,
and what the walk owes it is four things about the batch and no equation
with any other set: that the ball its chain built is the ball of the
*game* arena — which is why `descendCom` expands `gamName j` and not
`alvName j` — that the batch stays inside that ball, that it holds the
connector, and that for every earlier round the state records and the
search reaches it holds the support of the walk the search found, where
the ball keeps it.

**The nonemptiness clause is at `W ∩ X`** (wave R1.8-T3-flip (c2a)):
`RamDriver.enumBatch` reads the batch out through the cluster
indicator, so what it needs nonempty is the batch's cluster half. The
connector supplies it — the descent reads it out of the ordering at the
position `clusterLoad` materialized the cluster of, and
`RamCover.self_mem_wreach` is unconditional.

**Rebase B2 (§5.3): the size clause — restated at the inclusion it
came from (rebase G2/E6).** The postcondition carries one more line:
every vertex the next depth's arena marks lies in the *cluster* of the
centre this turn is processing. B2 carried only its cardinality
consequence `arenaSize n Alv' ≤ blockSize Xoff (σ.vars (curName j))`;
the G2 interface reads budgets at arena *weights*, and the weighted
consequence (`Refine.MassWeight.arenaWeight_le_blockWeight`) needs the
inclusion itself, which is what the descent's own walk proves anyway:
`clusterLoad` marks exactly the turn's cluster, and the next-depth mask
is that indicator with two more masks multiplied in. The old reading is
recovered by `Refine.ArenaBlock.arenaSize_le_ncard` +
`ncard_clusterAt_le_blockSize`; without some such clause the nested
driver's budget — a function of the arena it is handed — cannot be
turned into a number the turn's cost condition may mention, since
`Alv'` is existentially quantified here. -/

/-- **The padding.** That `RamDriver.enumBatch` leaves in `wa` an
enumeration of the batch by exactly `mb` entries.

One walk over two loops: the first collects the marked vertices in
vertex order, the second repeats the first entry to the fixed width.
What the result is worth is `RamDriver.exists_pad_enum`, proved in the
driver — a nonempty set of at most `mb` elements is the range of a map
from `Fin mb` — and `FormulaTables.range_comp_of_surjective` is why the
repetition costs the isolation rewrite nothing. The pass writes `wa` and
three counters and nothing else, which is why everything it is handed
comes back. -/

/-- **The colouring of the next depth.** That `RamDriver.colourCom`
writes the whole depth-`(j+1)` palette.

Three walks, one per slot family, and each is an expansion chain in the
*cluster-restricted* arena `resName j`: `oldCom` for
`Evaluator.isoColoring_slotOld`, `pdCom` for `isoColoring_slotPd` and
`puCom` for `isoColoring_slotPu`. The chains are `RamDriver.chainCom`,
whose content is `RamDriver.expandCom` iterated, and the packing
arithmetic is `RamDriver.oldIdx`, `pdIdx` and `puIdx` — the numeric
values of `FormulaTables.oldSlots`, `pdSlots` and `puSlots`, so no
packing appears in the program text. The postcondition is stated as the
one equation those three walks add up to: the colouring the arrays hold
is `RamDriver.stepColoringP`.

`CsrGraph G ns O T` and `WordBoundK B n d ns cap mb` prefix the obligation
for the reason they prefix `DescendStep`: the expansion chains of the
three slot families read the block structure, and nothing in the
precondition ties `O` and `T` to `G`. Without them the obligation is
**refutable** — its postcondition speaks about `masked G M`, the program
has been told only about `O` and `T`, and any `G` disagreeing with the
block structure refutes it. -/

The kill set is `X ∩ {alive at j} ∩ W` — in the cluster, alive at the
parent depth, in the batch — and by `BatchData`'s pointwise clause (wave
R1.8-T1) that is exactly the half of the child depth's dead set this
turn is responsible for: there `Alv' v = 0`, so the row's content is the
*edgeless* reading (`Refine.DeadRow.sat_bot_of_dead₁`), and the clause
below states it in the child arena, which is the form
`RamDriver.TableInv` at depth `j + 1` reads. The other half of the child
depth's dead set is the outside class, which no per-vertex pass can
afford (`Refine.DeadRowProbe.no_coeff_pays_outsideRows`) and none needs
(`stepColoringP_subset`: it carries one row, the empty one).

Note the domain is stated at the *turn's own* data — the parent mask, the
cluster and the batch — and not at `Alv'`: the kill set is what this
pass can see, and the child mask alone cannot tell a kill from a vertex
that was dead already. -/

/-- **The kill pass.** That `RamDriver.killCom` writes the child-depth
row of every vertex this turn killed, and nothing else of what the turn
holds.

The walk is the padded batch buffer, `mb` entries, so the precondition
carries `ClusterWa` — the pass is the third and last consumer of the
seam, and it still stands strictly before the nested call. The row body
is the depth-`(j+1)` straight line of `RamDriver.botCom` fragments, so
the precondition also carries the child palette (the arrays, their bit
clause and the equation `ColourStep` left), the depth's table lengths
`RamDriver.TablesSized` and the evaluator's scratch
`RamDriver.BaseArrs`. What discharges it is
`Refine.KillPass.killStep`; the mathematics is one rewrite, the edgeless
reading into the child arena's at a killed vertex
(`Refine.DeadRow.sat_bot_of_dead₁`), and everything else is names. -/

/-- **The kill set of one turn, listed once each** (wave R1.8-T3-flip,
design §6 (a2)): what `RamDriver.killListCom` leaves in `klName j`, and
what the atom pass's kill walk reads after the nested call returns.

The set enumerated is exactly `KillRowsAt`'s domain — the vertices alive
at the parent depth, in the cluster and in the batch — which is this
turn's half of the child depth's dead set (`BatchData`'s pointwise
clause, wave R1.8-T1). The four clauses are the four
`Refine.ScatterDeadFold.sum_bit_eq_ncard_inter` consumes: the entries
are vertices, the enumeration is repetition-free, everything listed is
in the set, and everything in the set is listed.

**Repetition-freeness is the whole point.** The buffer `"wa"` already
enumerates the batch, but the padding repeats its first entry and
`ClusterWa` pins only the buffer's *range*, so a bit sum over the buffer
double-counts a kill — `Refine.KillListPass` §0 compiles that refutation
against the scan-free walk. The dedupe is what makes the second clause
below true, and the second clause is `sum_bit_eq_ncard_inter`'s `hinj`.

The physical length is `mb`, not the carrier: the list is a sub-list of
the buffer's entries, so the buffer's own width bounds it, which is why
the clause rides `RamDriver.DepthMem` at `(klName j, mb)` and no carrier
reading enters. -/

/-- **The kill list pass.** That `RamDriver.killListCom` enumerates the
turn's kill set into the depth's own list, and disturbs nothing the turn
holds.

Its position inside `RamDriver.clusterCom` is forced from both sides.
The walk reads the padded buffer, so the precondition carries
`ClusterWa` and the pass must stand strictly before the nested call,
which repads it — the kill list is the *fourth* and last consumer of the
seam. And its product is a per-depth name, so it is still there when the
nested call returns, which is the only reason a list can serve the atom
pass at all.

The precondition is the kill pass's postcondition, plus the seam, plus
the sizing `∃ g, arrs (klName j) = arrOf mb g` — which is
`RamDriver.DepthMem.kl`, a clause of `TurnPre` already, so nothing new is
asked of a caller. `RamDriverRoot.killListStep` is the discharge and
`Refine.KillListPass.killListCom_spec` the walk; `KillRowsAt` rides
through because the pass writes one array of a name no table has, so the
kill pass's capital is not dropped at the seam. -/

/-- **The scatter atoms.** That the fold of the depth's atom programs
over the depth's table decides every scatter atom of every tabled
formula.

One call of `RamScatter.scatterCom` per atom, preceded by the two copies
that are the driver's calling convention: the depth-`(j+1)` mask into
`alv` and the depth-`(j+1)` table row of the atom's own formula into
`tab`. `RamScatter.scatter_spec` is the call, and its hypothesis
`hTab` — that the table row is the indicator of the set the atom speaks
about — is `TableInv` at depth `j + 1`, read at the position
`RamDriver.posOf` names, which is a position of the entry by
`RamDriver.getElem_posOf` and
`FormulaTables.mem_tablesAt_succ_of_mem_bcAtomsOf_right`.

**Wave R1.8-T3-flip (c1c): the two antecedents the dead-aware phase
needs.** They sit here rather than inside the `Spec` because both are
about the *turn's data* and neither is about a state.

* `hXalive` — every vertex of the cluster is alive at the parent depth —
  is `Refine.ScatterDeadPass.atomTerms_iff_scatVal`'s hypothesis of the
  same name. Its producer is `DescendStep`'s cluster clause at an alive
  centre (`Refine.MassAlive.clusterAt_subset_alive`), which is why
  `RamDriver.ClusterStepImplements` carries `M (ord k) ≠ 0`.
* `hbud` — a slot weight and a size for every ball of the child arena —
  is `Refine.ScatterBlock.scatBlock_specW`'s `hbud`, quantified over the
  radius because the radius is the atom's. It is a *parameter pair*
  `(bw, nb)` and not a fixed reading so that the budget can be narrowed
  without re-threading anything. **Wave B4-walk-1** narrowed it: the
  discharge is `RamDriverRoot.ballBudget_cluster` at the turn's own
  block, `(blockRowSum, blockSize)`, and the carrier witness
  `Refine.ScatterDeadPass.ballBudget_carrier` at `(ns, n)` is what the
  frames path still uses.

**Wave R1.8-T3-flip (c1d): the phase IS the dead-aware one.** The
command below is the fold of `RamDriver.scatterDeadCom`, not of the
retired `scatterCom`, and the two antecedents above are no longer
vacuous — both are consumed by
`Refine.ScatterDeadPass.atomTerms_iff_scatVal_of_clusterData` inside
`Refine.ScatterDeadTurn.scatterDeadStep`, which is the discharge. The
postcondition is **unchanged**, character for character: what the phase
leaves is still every scatter atom's greedy value in the cluster step's
arena, and no consumer of this obligation moves.

The precondition gains `RamDriver.BaseArrs` (and with it the level's
`ℓ`), because the outside class's bit is one `RamDriver.botCom`
fragment and the generated evaluator's candidate arrays are a
precondition of running one. `clusterStepImplements` already holds it at
the point the phase runs — it is `hbarr` carried across the recursion —
so nothing above the turn owes anything new.

**Wave R1.8-T3-flip (c2b): the table clause is on `rowDom`.** The
phase's input contract is no longer `RamDriver.TableInv` at the child
depth but `RamDriver.TableInvOn` at `rowDom M Alv' X W` — the child's
alive vertices plus this turn's kills. That is exactly the set the walk
reads (`Refine.ScatterDeadTurn.scatDead_spec`: the kill list's entries,
the child's filtered member list, and no other cell), and exactly the
set the nested level hands back. The postcondition carries the same
clause; the *flag* clause is untouched. -/

/-- **The readback.** That `RamDriver.readbackCom` writes, at every
vertex the cluster was assigned, the value of every tabled formula's own
boolean combination, and leaves every other vertex's cell alone.

This is the driver's readback obligation, repaired. The version
`Lax3Proofs.RamDriver` used to carry handed the atoms' valuation as a
function of the *entering* state, so a local atom — whose truth varies
from vertex to vertex — was evaluated at whatever the scalar `z`
happened to hold before the loop started; the valuation has to be
indexed by the vertex the readback stands on, and here it is. The walk itself is the one that obligation describes: one
loop, a conditional, a straight line of stores, and the arithmetic of
the bits — that `RamDriver.bcExpr` of a valuation into `{0, 1}` is again
in `{0, 1}` and is nonzero exactly when `BC.eval` holds, an induction on
the combination. What the value *means* is not asked here.

**Wave R1.8-T3-flip (c2b): `rowDom`, and the visited-vertex clause.**
The child-depth table clause is `RamDriver.TableInvOn` at
`rowDom M Alv' X W`, and what makes that enough is the new precondition
conjunct — every vertex the turn was assigned is alive at the parent
depth and lies in the cluster. A visited vertex is then either alive at
the child depth or a vertex THIS turn killed (`BatchData`'s pointwise
clause), so its row exists; that is
`Refine.DeadRowProbe.readback_dead_read_is_kill` at the turn's own data,
and it is the reason the readback needs no outside-class row. The
producer of the clause is the descent's ball postcondition plus the
alive-centre guard, both of which live only inside
`clusterStepImplements`, where `X` is existential. -/

off its syntax. This is that frame, stated at the same command so that
`spec_conj` merges the two into one specification.

It is not a new obligation on the driver: `RamDriver.driverAt` writes
only the arrays of the depths at or **above** its own and the fixed
names its sub-programs address, so every clause below is a frame
condition of the recursion, discharged the same way at every level —

/-! ### One cluster

The composition. Every step of it is one of the six specifications
above or the obligation's own hypothesis; the one thing that is not
composition is the last line, where the boolean combination the readback
wrote turns into satisfaction at the depth's own arena by
`RamDriver.sat_iff_eval_step`, at the cluster the cover produced and the
batch the searches produced. -/

open Classical in
/-- **One cluster, discharged.** The turn of the loop over the centres
leaves the table of every vertex the centre was assigned correct.

The six walks compose into a run of `RamDriver.clusterCom`, and what
the run leaves is turned into the obligation's postcondition by
`RamDriver.sat_iff_eval_step` — a tabled formula holds at a vertex of
the depth's arena exactly when its own boolean combination evaluates to
true over the depth-`(j+1)` tables and the scatter values of the cluster
step's arena, which is what the readback wrote there. The hypothesis
that lemma needs of the cluster — that it contains the `cap`-ball of the
vertex — is the descent's postcondition, which is
`RamCover.CoverOut.asg_cover` at the centre being processed; the batch
is the program's own and nothing is asked of it.

**Wave R1.8-T2: the kill pass, and the seam it needs.** `hkill` is the
sixth walk, run between the colouring and the nested call, and its
postcondition — `KillRowsAt` at the turn's own kill set — is the capital
wave R1.8-T3 consumes when it weakens `RamDriver.TableInv` to
`alive ∪ kills`. It is *not* threaded into this obligation's own
postcondition: the nested level still runs `RamDriver.sweepCom` and still
hands back the carrier-wide `TableInv`, so the turn owes nothing new. The
one thing the composition needs is `hwafr` — that the colouring leaves
the padding buffer alone — which is what carries `ClusterWa` across
`colourCom` and makes the kill pass the third consumer of the
seam, still strictly before the recursion
(`RamDriverFrames.wa_notMem_warrs_colourCom`).

**Wave R1.8-T3-flip (a2): the kill list.** `hklist` is the seventh walk,
run between the kill pass and the nested call, and it is the *fourth*
and last consumer of the `ClusterWa` seam — `hkill`'s own postcondition
carries the buffer across the kill pass by the same `Run.frame_arr`
argument `hwa₃` makes across the colouring. Its postcondition
`KillListAt` — the turn's kill set, listed once each in the depth's own
`klName j` — is the capital the atom pass of scope (b) consumes *after*
the nested call, since the name is per-depth and the recursion leaves it
alone. Like `hkill`'s, it is not threaded into this obligation's own
postcondition: nothing above the turn owes it yet, and the list crosses
`inner` only when (b) makes it.

**Wave R1.8-T3-flip (c2b): the nested call's pre-written domain.** The
turn instantiates `RamDriver.LevelImplementsD`'s domain `D'` at
`killSet M X W` — the set the kill pass wrote rows for and the kill list
enumerated. `KillRowsAt.tableInvOn` (off `RamDriver.TablesSized`) is the
precondition, `killSet_dead` off `BatchData`'s pointwise clause is the
subset-of-dead side condition, and what comes back is
`RamDriver.TableInvOn` at `alive' ∪ kills` — exactly the domain the atom
phase and the readback read. Nothing above the turn is asked for
anything new: `X`, `W` and `Alv'` are existential here, so `D'` is
built and consumed inside this proof. -/

`RamDriver.driverAt … j` is the ordering pass, the cover pass, and the
loop over the centres the cover produced. The first two enter through
the driver's own obligations; the loop is `Spec.forRangeZero`, its body
`RamDriver.ClusterStepImplements`, and what it leaves is the table
invariant of the depth — because the turns partition the carrier, which
is `RamCover.CoverOut.asg_lt`. -/

/-- **What one cluster leaves alone.** `RamDriver.ClusterStepImplements`
says what the turn wrote at the vertices of the centre it was
processing; the loop needs, on top of that, that it wrote nothing at the
vertices of the centres already processed, and that the cover's three
answers are still there for the next turn. Neither is a frame condition
that can be read off the syntax — the turn contains the nested driver,
which is a variable — so both are stated here, at the same precondition,
and `spec_conj` merges them with the driver's obligation into one
specification of one command. -/

/-- **What the centre loop carries.** The depth's state, its table
arrays, the cover's answers, the compacted centre list, the output tape
as it was, and the tables of the vertices whose centre has already been
processed. The last clause is stated over *any* cell function the array
happens to have, since a turn hands its own back.

**Rebase B3.** The loop counter is `cixName j`, an index into the
compacted list `cps`, and "already processed" is therefore
`∃ k < cix, asg v = cps k` rather than `asg v < cur`: the turns still
partition the carrier, but they enumerate the *listed* positions and no
longer the carrier. `Compacted.covers` at the exit is what says every
vertex has had its turn — its assigned position holds it, so its block
is nonempty, so the compaction listed it.

**Wave R1.8-T3-flip (c2b).** The table clause's dead half is no longer
"every dead vertex" but "every vertex of the pre-written domain `D`" —
the level owes rows on `alive ∪ D` and on nothing else, and `D`'s rows
were written by the caller, not by any pass of this level. At entry the
clause is exactly `RamDriver.TableInvOn` at `D`, which is the level's
own precondition; at the exit the alive half is supplied by
`Compacted.covers` as before. What keeps `D` intact across a turn is
the same fact that used to force the sweep:
`Refine.ArenaBlock.dead_vertex_has_no_alive_turn` — the centre of a dead
vertex is dead, and the compaction lists live centres only. -/

/-- **One level, discharged.** `RamDriver.driverAt … j` establishes the
table invariant of its depth, for every depth at or above the bottom.

Downward induction on the budget still to spend. At `j = ℓ` it is the
base case's hypothesis. Below `ℓ` it is the ordering pass, the cover
pass, and `Refine.SigmaLoop.forRangeZeroSum` over the centres with
`RamDriver.ClusterStepImplements` as its body — the nested driver
entering that body as the induction hypothesis at `j + 1`. What the loop
leaves is the table invariant of the whole carrier, because the turns
partition it: `RamCover.CoverOut.asg_lt` assigns every vertex to a
centre, so at the exit every vertex has had its own turn, and
`ClusterFrames` is why no later turn undid it.

**Rebase B2: the Σ/size interface** (`integration-design.md` §5.6).
Every cost is read at a **measure of the arena** — since rebase G2/E6
an abstract one: a level costs `Kl j (wA M)`, a turn
`Ks j (wB Xoff Xmem k)` on its own block, and the loop pays the **sum**
of its turns rather than `n` times the worst one —
`Refine.SigmaLoop.forRangeZeroSum` in place of `Spec.forRangeZero`. The
readings `wA`/`wB` are parameters because the G2 instantiation
(`Refine.MassWeight.arenaWeight`/`blockWeight`, the arena weight at the
level's fixed graph) lives above this file in the import order;
`wA := arenaSize n`, `wB := fun Xoff _ => blockSize Xoff` is the landed
size reading, and `RamDriverRoot.levelAt` instantiates the weights. Two
hypotheses carry the arithmetic that makes the sum affordable, and
neither is about the program:

* `hmass`, the mass mathematics — that the compacted loop takes at most
  `wA M` turns, and that the turns' blocks sum to at most
  `Kmass · (wA M + 1)` (at the weight reading this is
  `Refine.MassWeight.mass_of_alive_compaction_weight`, same hypotheses,
  same coefficient). **Rebase F-c-3:** it is handed the
  ordering-property slot `P π ord` beside `RamCover.OrdersBy`, because
  the coefficient `Kmass` *is* the cover's degree and a cover's degree
  is a property of the ordering the phase built, not of every ordering.
  At `R = 0`, `P` is `fun _ _ => True` and the clause costs its supplier
  nothing; at `R = R*` it is `CoverDegree.AugChainData`, and
  `RamDriverRoot.wreachDeg_of_orderP` is the step from the slot to the
  degree. Before this the phase's `P` witness was destructured away one
  line after it arrived (`horder`'s postcondition), which left the
  root's `hdeg` slot asking for a bound at *every* permutation — a
  hypothesis with no possible producer. `Refine.ArenaBlock.mass_of_alive_compaction`
  is that pair, compiled, from wave B4's `Refine.MassAlive.aliveMass_le`
  plus **one clause `RamDriver.compactCom` does not yet establish**: that
  the listed centres are alive. It is threaded parametrically here
  because supplying it means filtering the compaction, and an
  alive-filtered compaction leaves the *dead* vertices without a turn —
  `Refine.ArenaBlock.dead_vertex_has_no_alive_turn` compiles that, and
  the partition step below is what it contradicts. That is the campaign's
  open item; nothing in this theorem's shape depends on how it is
  resolved.
* `hK`, the level's cost side condition in the Σ shape —
  `CostRecurrence.exists_driverCostsSigma` discharges it in one call, up
  to the three-unit shift the compacted loop's `cps` read costs
  (`RamDriverRoot.levelCost_of_sigma`). The old `Kd` summand is gone:
  wave R1.8-T3-flip (c2b) removed the dead-row sweep it paid for from
  `RamDriver.driverAux`, so retaining that summand would overstate the
  program's cost.

**Wave B4-walk-1: the frame's budget is its own.** `hframe` is stated at
a cost family `Ksf` of its own instead of at `hstep`'s `Ks`. The two are
merged by `spec_conj`, which keeps the **first** specification's budget
and drops the second's, so the frames path's number never reaches the
conclusion — `Refine.B4Design.frames_cost_is_dead_weight` is that fact
compiled, at an arbitrary margin. The generalisation is a weakening:
`Ksf := Ks` is the landed statement, and it is what
`RamDriverRoot.levelAt` still passes. What it buys is that the step path
may run its scatter charge at a *block-scale* ball budget while the
frames path keeps the carrier one, without the level's turn cost having
to dominate both.

**Wave R1.8-T3-flip (c2b): the pre-written domain, and no sweep.** The
statement runs over a set `D` of vertices whose rows the caller has
already written, and it establishes `alive ∪ D`. `hsweep` is gone; what
replaced it is `hphfr`, that neither carrier phase of a level writes a
table, which carries the caller's rows across the ordering and the cover
to the loop's first turn. Inside the loop `LevelInv`'s dead half is
`v ∈ D`, and what keeps it there is the landed `hdeadne` block —
`Refine.ArenaBlock.dead_vertex_has_no_alive_turn` plus the compaction's
alive filter: a vertex of `D` is dead, its assigned centre is dead, and
the loop lists live centres only, so no turn of this level can be its
turn.

`Refine.ArenaBlock.sum_blockSize_compacted_le` is what connects them:
the turns' blocks are distinct blocks of the one arena, so their sizes
sum to at most its mass. **No semantic clause of the induction moved**:
the partition argument, the frames and the table invariant are B3's,
untouched.

The carrier is no longer asked to be nonempty: `RamDriver.TablesSized`
is the depth's table arrays at the carrier's length, carried by the
level's own precondition, so the loop no longer has to *produce* that
fact from a turn having been taken.

The block structure is asked for in the *simple* form
`RamElim.CsrSimple` — `RamBfs.CsrGraph` with no row naming a vertex
twice — because that is what the ordering phase's two eliminations need
and what `RamDriver.OrderImplements` therefore takes; the cover phase
and the cluster step take the weaker `CsrGraph`, and get it from
`hcsr.csr`. Nothing between the root and here can bridge the two, so the
clause is data of the input encoding.

**The value bound, and the two arena slots** (rebase E-mem/W2). `hB` is
`RamDriver.WordBoundK` at a degree parameter `d` the induction never
looks at: every phase but one reads only the five projections, so the
level is uniform in `d` and hands its own `hB` down unchanged. The
exception is the cover phase, whose two values are addresses *into* the
cluster arena — the emission scan's running pointer and the pass's exit
pointer — and those are `hptr` and `hexit`, quantified here over the
mask and the ordering because the ordering is produced inside the loop
and the mask changes with the depth. Both have a carrier reading
(`RamDriver.ptrWords_of_square`, `massWords_of_square`, off the retired
`WordBound.cover`) and a mass reading
(`Refine.ArenaPointer.ptrWords_of_mass`, `massWords_of_mass`, off
`WordBoundK` at the cover's degree); this theorem is indifferent to
which, and that is the whole point of their being slots.

Both slots carry `RamCover.OrdersBy n π ord` as a hypothesis (W3). The
mass readings need it — the double count of `Refine.MassMath` is over
the ordering's own fibres — and the loop has it in hand at the one
point either slot is used, since the ordering phase produced `π` and
`ord` together with it. The carrier readings ignore it, so this costs
the landed instantiation nothing. -/
