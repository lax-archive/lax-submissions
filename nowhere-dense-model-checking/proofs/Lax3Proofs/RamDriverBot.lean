/-!
The **base case of the driver**, walked: `Lax3Proofs.RamDriver.baseCom`
against `Lax3Proofs.BotEval`.

At depth `ℓ` the arena is edgeless and the tables are evaluated
outright. The pass is a walk of the carrier that runs, at every vertex,
the generated evaluator `RamDriver.botCom` of every formula of the
bottom table and stores its bit.

**R1.8-T4a — the representative scan is out of the program.**
`RamDriver.baseCom` used to open with `RamDriver.reprCom`. Its product
`"rep"` is read only by the `exU` case of `botCom`, and that case is
generated for no tabled formula (they are all local — see *The
unrestricted quantifier* below), so the scan guarded nothing and its
cost — a carrier walk with a `2 ^ sigL cap mb ℓ`-wide inner loop,
`reprCost` — charged the base's budget for dead code. `baseCost` sheds
it, `base_spec` sheds the two hypotheses that were only the scan's
(`2 ^ sigL cap mb ℓ < B` and *the `"rep"` table is sized*), and
`rep_notMem_warrs_baseCom` records that nothing the base pass runs
writes `"rep"`. The scan itself and its walk stay compiled below: they
are the contingency's machine half (`Refine.DeadRowProbe`'s base story).

# What is proved here

* `repr_spec` — **the representative scan**, no longer part of any
  program (`RamDriver.reprCom`'s docstring). Its invariant is *the rep
  table holds one representative of every row realized below the
  counter, and its entries are pairwise row-distinct*; the second half
  is what bounds the table's length by `2 ^ sigL cap mb ℓ`
  (`le_two_pow_of_rowEq_inj`) and hence what gives the recording store a
  derivation at all. The first half is `BotEval.exists_offRepr`'s
  conclusion read off the program, and is exported.
* `bot_spec` — **the generated evaluator**, by induction on the formula.
  The five atoms are `BotEval.sat_adj_bot`, `sat_eq_bot`,
  `sat_color_bot`, `sat_distLe_bot` and `sat_distColorLt_bot`, all three
  through the one shape `test_spec`; the connectives are truncated
  arithmetic; the local quantifier is `BotEval.sat_exL_bot`, its guard
  set loaded by `guardFold_spec` and scanned by `Spec.forRangeZero`.
  The fresh-name discipline is `Ext`, a `List.IsPrefix` on the names,
  and the frame it gives is `bot_framed`.
* `base_block_spec`, `base_turn_spec`, `base_spec` — **the pass**: the
  straight line of fragments of one vertex, one turn, and the walk of
  the carrier, ending in `BaseTabOk … (fun _ => n)`, which is
  `RamDriver.TableInv`'s content on the edgeless arena.
* the syntactic frames the obligation's own bookkeeping needs:
  `wvars_botCom`, `warrs_botCom`, `wvars_baseCom`, `warrs_baseCom`,
  `noWrite_baseCom`, and — since R1.8-T4a — `rep_notMem_warrs_baseCom`
  and `rp_notMem_wvars_baseCom`.

# The unrestricted quantifier

`botCom`'s `exU` case is **not** walked, and cannot be. Its candidate
list is the environment together with the *global* representative table,
one vertex per row of the whole arena, while
`BotEval.sat_exU_bot_of_repr` asks for one representative per row
realized **off the environment**: a row realized by an entry of the
environment and by exactly one vertex outside it makes the generated
loop answer *false* where the truth is *true* (`n = 2`, no colours,
`m = (0)`, `ψ = ∃x₁. x₁ ≠ x₀`). The case is also never reached — every
tabled formula is local, by
`FormulaTables.tableRank_of_mem_tablesAt` — so the walk carries
`IsLocal` and discharges `exU` by `SyntaxLemmas.isLocal_exU`. Repairing
`reprCom` would mean recording `k + 1` vertices per row; nothing above
depends on that being done.

Since R1.8-T4a the case is not only unreached but **unwritten-for**: the
`"rep"` table it would read is produced by no pass of the driver. The
generated text is unchanged — for a local formula `botCom` has no `exU`
node, so no program the driver runs contains the read — and the two
lemmas that say so are `bot_spec` (a fragment of a local formula runs
and answers correctly at a state about whose `"rep"` nothing is
assumed) and `rep_notMem_warrs_baseCom`.

# What is left

`RamDriver.BaseImplements` itself is **not** discharged here. What
remains is the translation of `base_spec` into that surface — the frame
of `RamDriver.LevelPre` across the pass, which the four syntactic
lemmas above deliver. The two clauses the surface was missing are now
conjuncts of it:

* **the colour cells are bits** (`∀ c < sigL cap mb ℓ, ∀ v < n,
  C c v ≤ 1`) is a hypothesis of `RamDriver.BaseImplements` and of
  `RamDriver.LevelImplements`, produced one depth at a time by
  `RamDriverCluster.ColourStep`, whose postcondition now carries it;
* **the base evaluator's memory** is `RamDriver.BaseArrs`, the
  representative table at `2 ^ sigL cap mb ℓ` together with
  `RamDriver.BaseMem` — the candidate array of every local quantifier of
  every formula of the bottom table. Both are lengths, so `BaseArrs.run`
  carries them down the recursion and back; `RamDriver.BotMem` and
  `botMem_of_length` live at the surface for the same reason.

/-! ### Rows, and how many there are

The base case's only question about a vertex is which colours it
carries. The scan compares two vertices by comparing the *cells* of the
depth's colour arrays, so the row it works with is the numeric one; on
arrays holding bits — which is what every pass that writes a colour
array leaves — that is the row of `Lax3Proofs.BotEval.rowOf`, and there
are `2 ^ L` of them. -/

table already built decides whether the vertex's row has been seen. The
outer invariant is **the rep table holds one representative of every row
realized below the counter, and its entries are pairwise row-distinct**;
the second half is what bounds the table's length, by

/-! ### The fresh names of the generated evaluator

`RamDriver.botCom` names the scratch of a fragment by extending the
fragment's own output name with one character per level, so the names of
two sibling fragments are incomparable and the name of an enclosing
fragment is not one of its body's. That is the whole of the frame
discipline, and — the extension being by *append* — it is decided by
`List.IsPrefix` and needs none of the digit machinery of
`RamDriverBase`: only the environment slots, whose names carry a
number, are compared through `toString`. -/

Read off the syntax: a fragment assigns to names below its own output
name and to the environment slots at or above its arity, and it stores
only into arrays below its output name. The unrestricted quantifier is
the one case that leaves the discipline — it assigns the scan variable
of the representative table — and it is also the one case a *local*
formula never reaches. -/

/-! ### The generated evaluator

`RamDriver.botCom ℓ ψ out` is `Lax3Proofs.BotEval` read as code, and its
walk is the induction that generated it. Three things travel with it:
the depth's colour arrays, which it only reads; the environment slots
below its arity, which it only reads; and the candidate array of every
local quantifier inside it, which it writes. The first two are framed by
the name discipline above, and the third is the one clause the walk asks
of its caller.

The unrestricted quantifier is not walked, and cannot be: its
representative table is one vertex per row of the *whole* arena, while
`BotEval.sat_exU_bot_of_repr` asks for one per row realized *off the
environment*, and a row realized only by an entry of the environment and
by one vertex outside it is a counterexample to the program as written.
It is also never reached — every tabled formula is local, by
`FormulaTables.tableRank_of_mem_tablesAt` — so the walk carries
`IsLocal` and discharges that case by `SyntaxLemmas.isLocal_exU`. -/

  ∀ c < L, σ.arrs (colName jd c) = arrOf n (C c)

/-! `RamDriver.BotMem` is the memory clause of the generated evaluator —
the candidate array of every local quantifier, at the width its guard
set is loaded at. It lives at the surface rather than here because it is
a *precondition* of `RamDriver.BaseImplements`, and `RamDriver.BaseArrs`
packages it with the representative table. `RamDriver.botMem_of_length`
is that it survives any run. -/

/-! ### The base pass

`RamDriver.baseCom` is the representative scan followed by a walk of the
carrier that evaluates every formula of the bottom table at every
vertex. The walk of one vertex is a straight line of fragments, one per
tabled formula, each followed by the store of its bit. -/

/-! The two member names begin with `'m'` (rebase E-mem), which is all the

/-- **The cells of one table of the depth, at a prefix of a LIST of
vertices together with a set the walk does not touch** (wave R1.8-T4b).
`BaseTabOk` above is this at the identity list and the empty set
(`baseTabOk_of_baseTabMem_id`), which is what a carrier walk visits; the
base pass visits the depth's member list, and its invariant is this at
that list.

Two generalizations of `BaseTabOk`, and each buys one half of the wave.

* The bound `bd` is a *list index* and not a vertex. That is what makes
  the arithmetic of the block — "the tables below `p` are right one entry
  further than the tables above it" — character for character the carrier
  walk's, so one block walk serves both headers.
* `Dm` is a set of cells that are *already* right and that the walk
  neither has to visit nor may destroy. It rides for free: the only cell
  a turn writes is its own member, and the bit it writes there is the
  right one, so a `Dm` cell is either untouched or freshly correct and no
  disjointness hypothesis is needed anywhere. This is what carries the
  caller's pre-written domain (`RamDriver.BaseImplementsD`'s `D`, whose
  rows are correct on the edgeless arena because `D` is dead —
  `Refine.DeadRow.sat_bot_of_dead`) across the base pass. -/

the invariant read at the list's own prefix (`BaseTabMem`).

This is the landed carrier block (`base_block_spec` below, which is this
at `Mem := id`) generalized in one direction only: the counter is an
index into `Mem` rather than a vertex. Nothing in the program text moves
— the store is still `.var "z"`, and `"z"` still holds the vertex — which
is why the two headers of wave T4b share one block walk. -/

/-- **The cost of the base pass**: one walk of the depth's **member
list**, whose turn is the depth's own straight line of `botCom`
fragments plus the load of the member.

The size argument is the member count `mm` — the depth's *arena*, not the
carrier (`RamDriver.MemEnum.card_le_arenaSize` is what turns the one into
the other, and `base_spec` charges the walk at it). That is the whole
content of wave R1.8-T4b on the cost side: `Refine.G2CostProbe.sweepCoeffA`
pays this at every arena weight (`Refine.G2CostProbe.hKbase_paid`), and no
constant at all paid the carrier reading
(`Refine.G2CostProbe.hKbase_gap_any`).

**Where the `7` comes from.** The turn is the sweep's turn — `turnCost`,
i.e. `blockCost + 6` — plus `3` for `.assign "z" (.get (memName ℓ) …)`,
the one instruction the member header adds; `Spec.forRangeZero` then adds
its own `4` per turn and `6` for the initialisation. So the member walk
pays three more per *member* than the carrier walk paid per *vertex*
(`Refine.DeadSweep.sweepCost_le_baseCost`), and reads a set that is the
arena instead of the carrier. `Refine.GapsDesign.baseCostM` proposed the
same shape at `+4`, i.e. with the member load free; the load is not free,
and the slot pays either way.

**R1.8-T4a.** The summand `reprCost ℓ (sigL cap mb ℓ) n` is gone with the
representative scan — a second carrier walk with a `2 ^ sigL cap mb ℓ`
inner loop, paid for a case no tabled formula generates. The ledger of
that shed is `Refine.BaseShed`, stated at the pre-T4b constant it is
about. -/

/-! #### The member header (wave R1.8-T4b)

The base pass's loop. Everything below the loop header is the carrier
walk's: the turn calls `base_block_mem_spec` — the same block at the same
`"z"` — and the invariant is the same tables read at a prefix of a list,
that list now being the depth's member list rather than the identity. -/

/-- **The invariant of the base pass**: the tables are right at every
member the cursor has passed, and the member list and its count are where
`RamDriver.LevelPre`'s sixteenth clause put them.

The list rides as a parameter rather than existentially: the walk opens
`LevelPre`'s `∃` once, at `base_spec`, and the loop is uniform in what it
finds (`Refine.MemThreadProbe.memList_unique` is why any two openings
agree). -/

/-- **The base pass, walked.** After it, every table of the bottom depth
holds, at every **alive** vertex, the truth value of its formula on the
edgeless arena — and the walk is charged at the number of them.

**Wave R1.8-T4b.** Three changes. The walk is the depth's member list, so
the charge is `baseCost … mm φ` at the *arena's* size and no longer at the
carrier; the answer is quantified over the alive vertices, since the pass
writes no other row; and the precondition gains the member list itself
(`RamDriver.MemEnum`, which the caller has out of
`RamDriver.LevelPre`'s sixteenth clause) with its own bound `mm < B`.

**R1.8-T4a.** Two hypotheses of the pre-T4a statement were the
representative scan's alone and are gone with it: `2 ^ sigL cap mb ℓ < B`
(the scan's counter had to fit a word) and *the `"rep"` table is sized*
(the scan's store had to have a cell). -/

/-! ### The obligation

`RamDriver.BaseImplements` is the base case's obligation. What is
proved below is that obligation with two hypotheses on its parameters,
in the manner of `RamDriverBase.readbackStep`:

* **the colour cells are bits.** The representative scan compares two
  vertices by comparing colour *cells*, so the rows it distinguishes are
  the numeric ones, and its table is `2 ^ sigL cap mb ℓ` long — which
  bounds the scan only if a cell is `0` or `1`. Every pass that writes a
  colour array writes a bit, so this is a clause missing from those
  passes' postconditions rather than a property missing from the
  program;
* **the base evaluator's memory.** `RamDriver.botCom` stores the guard
  set of every local quantifier into a candidate array of its own name,
  and no precondition of `BaseImplements` says those arrays are there:
  the clause `Sized [("rep", 2 ^ sigL cap mb ℓ)]` sizes the
  representative table and nothing else. `BaseMem` is the missing
  clause, and it enters here as the hypothesis that the obligation's own
  precondition implies it — which is where the surface has to grow. -/
