/-!
The locality decomposition as a *function*. The endorsed theorem
`Lax3.Locality.locality` is an existential: every formula of distance
rank `(k, q)` *has* an equivalent boolean combination of local formulas
and scatter sentences. A consumer that `Classical.choose`s it ad hoc gets
no guarantee that two use sites at the same `(choice, φ)` pick the same
combination — but the formula schedule of the algorithm (algorithm-v2
§8 step 3, §9 O2, D5) must depend only on `(φ, ε, C)`, never on the
input graph, so the decomposition has to be one fixed function.

This file makes that choice once. `localityBC` is the chosen
decomposition; the three spec lemmas split the axiom's conjunction so a
consumer takes exactly the clause it needs; `localityBC_irrel` records
that the rank witness does not enter the choice (definitional, by proof
irrelevance), so every use site at the same `(choice, φ)` sees the same
combination. `localAtoms` and `scatterAtoms` read the combination's atom
list apart into the two kinds — the data the schedule construction
iterates over — with membership lemmas returning each to `BC.atoms` and
with the axiom's side conditions restated over the lists.

Nothing here is computable and nothing needs to be: what the choice
buys is a function, not decidability.
