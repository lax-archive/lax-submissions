The **cover pass** of Grohe–Kreutzer–Siebertz §6, as a word-RAM program
with its correctness — and, before it, the one lemma that makes it a
program at all.

### The lemma

`CoverConstruction` builds the neighborhood cover of an ordering out of
the *fibres of weak reachability*: the cluster of a vertex `u` is the
set of vertices from which `u` is weakly `2r`-reachable, that is, the
set of `w` carrying a walk `w → u` of length at most `2r` on whose
support `u` is `π`-minimal. That is a definition, not an algorithm: the
minimality quantifies over the support of a walk, which no search
looks at.

The lemma that turns it into one is

    v ∈ wreach A π ρ w   ↔   WithinDist (deleteVerts A {u | π u < π v}) ρ v w

— `mem_wreach_iff_withinDist_pred`. The two sides are the same
condition read in the two directions. "Every vertex `y` on the walk has
`π v ≤ π y`" and "the walk never meets `{u | π u < π v}`" are literally
each other's contrapositives, and a walk that avoids an isolated set
survives isolation, while a walk of an isolated graph *starting* at a
surviving vertex never meets the isolated set at all — the empty walk
included, since `v` is not a predecessor of itself. So the fibre over
`v` **is a ball**: the ball the search of `Lax3Proofs.RamBfs` computes
when the mask kills exactly the vertices before `v`.

Everything else about the pass follows from arranging for the mask to
say that, which the program does by walking the centres in the
ordering's own order and killing each one after it is done.

### The program

`coverCom r` takes the block structure of `G`, an ambient mask, and the
order array `ord` — `ord c` is the vertex at position `c` — and for
each position in turn: searches to depth `2r` from `ord c` in the
current mask, scans the vertices once, emitting into a compressed-row
cluster arena everything the search put within `2r` and recording `c`
as the assignment of everything it put within `r` that nothing has
claimed yet, and then kills `ord c`.

Two radii, one distance array. The wider test is the cluster; the
narrower one is the *catch*, and the assignment records **first**
catches. That ordering is the algorithm. A centre that catches `w` at
radius `r` lies in the `r`-ball of `w` — by the lemma again, at radius
`r` — so the first catcher is the `π`-minimum of the ball among
catchers; and the `π`-minimum of the whole ball is itself a catcher,
because cutting the connecting walk anywhere keeps the cut point in the
ball, where that minimum is minimal. The two minima therefore agree,
and the covering argument of Lemma 6.9 applies to the vertex the
program wrote down. Recording first catches at radius `2r` instead
would be *wrong*, and cheaply so: a centre within `2r` of `w` need not
be within `r` of it, and then `w`'s ball need not be in its cluster.

### What a driver supplies, and what it gets

In: `off`/`tgt`, a `RamBfs.CsrGraph` block structure for `G`; `alv`,
the ambient mask, whose arena `RamBfs.masked G A₀` is what the whole
specification is about; `ord`, the order array of an ordering `π`, tied
to it by `OrdersBy` — one equation, `ord (π v) = v`, which
`ordersBy_rankPerm` produces from `RamElim`'s rank array and its
inverse; `dist`, `q`, `asg` of length `n`, `xoff` of length `n + 1` and
`xmem` of length `n²`. The radius is a program parameter, not an input.
The pass *writes into the mask*, so a caller that still wants the arena
keeps a copy.

Out: `xoff`/`xmem`, the clusters in compressed-row form, block `c`
holding exactly the fibre of the centre at position `c`; `asg`, sending
each vertex to a *position* whose cluster contains that vertex's whole
`r`-ball; and `xp`, the length used. `CoverPost` is those facts;
`isNeighborhoodCover_of_out` assembles them, plus the ordering's own
weak-reachability bound — which a density argument supplies and no
program computes — into `Lax3.NeighborhoodCovers.IsNeighborhoodCover`.

### What is proved

The lemma, the covering argument, and the whole of the pass's loop:
`CoverInv` is the invariant, `CoverInv.init` starts it, `CoverInv.step`
is one turn — stated against the search's distance array, whose
hypothesis is the search specification's threshold postcondition
verbatim — and `CoverInv.out` reads `CoverOut` off the state the loop
exits in. `cover_spec` assembles the fill, the two commands that open
the cluster arena, and the loop rule, and is proved from a single named
obligation: `Implements`, the Hoare triple for *one turn* of the loop,
`centreStep r`. What that obligation still owes is symbolic execution
— the source load, the search, the emission scan and the kill — and
nothing mathematical. The program is exhibited, compiled and run: the
worked example checks its three answers on a five-vertex graph, at four
settings of the mask and the radius, against the hand computation.

### Ledger — the tower search underneath (rebase P1)

The search the pass embeds is no longer `RamBfs.bfsCom` but the
refinement tower's synthesized queue BFS, through
`Lax3Proofs.Refine.BfsBridge.bfsQCom` (bridges P1/B-a … P1/B-c are
recorded in that file). Two entries belong here.

* **P1/B-d — the `q` word clause.** `CoverState` and `cover_spec`'s
  precondition gain `∀ v ∈ σ.arrs "q", v < B`. The tower export's
  `Ir.StateBound` is state-global, so it asks the *entering* cells of
  both scratch arrays to be words, where the hand-walked baseline
  bounded only what its run evaluated. The clause is free at every
  caller: `RamDriver.LevelMem` has carried it all along, beside the
  `dist` clause the pass already required for its own emission scan.

* **P1/B-e — the cost surface does not move.** `centreCost` and
  `coverCost` are unchanged. The tower search costs `56n + 40ns + 33`
  against the baseline's `51n + 44ns + 30`, plus `32` for the setup
  block, and the per-centre budget `100n + 50ns + 100` — deliberately
  generous, the shape being what the campaign spends against — absorbs
  the difference with room to spare (`90n + 40ns + 84` all told). So
  nothing above `CoverImplements` sees a new constant; the sharp cost
  is `bfsQK`'s and enters the recurrence at P4.

The worked example is the differential test of the swap: the four
`#guard`ed answers are unchanged, cell for cell, and only the cycle
counts move (5636→5611, 4316→4554, 4257→3833, 5894→6201). A search
that decided a different arena, or the threshold in the other
direction, would show up there before any proof was attempted.

/-- **The fibre bridge.** The vertex `v` is weakly `ρ`-reachable from
`w` exactly when `w` lies in the `ρ`-ball of `v` in the graph with
everything the ordering puts before `v` isolated.

# Proof strategy

Both directions are the same observation, read in the two directions:
*the support of a walk avoids the predecessors of `v`* and *`v` is
`π`-minimal on that support* are the same condition, since `π u ≤ π y`
is the negation of `π y < π u`. Left to right, the walk `w → v` whose
support `v` is minimal on therefore survives the isolation, and
reverses. Right to left, a walk of the isolated graph *starting* at `v`
— which is not a predecessor of itself, so the nil walk is covered too
— never meets the isolated set at all, so it is a walk of the original
graph on the same vertices, and reverses into a reachability walk. -/

/-! ### The ordering, as the program has it

The pass never looks at an ordering: it looks at the array the
elimination engine leaves, and walks it. Two numbers name a vertex —
its *position* `rk` in the ordering, which is the engine's rank, and
the vertex itself — and the order array `ord` is the map back from the
first to the second. That one equation is everything the program needs
of the ordering, and everything the proof needs of the array. -/

/-! ### The invariant of the pass

One structure, carrying what the four output arrays hold after the
first `c` centres have been processed, plus what the mask says. Its two
assignment clauses are the ones worth naming: a *recorded* assignment
is not merely some catcher of its vertex but the **minimal** one, and
an *unrecorded* one certifies that no catcher has been passed yet.
Together they say that the pass records first catches, and it is that
minimality — not the catching — that the covering argument consumes. -/

/-! ### One turn

The step is stated against what the turn *did* rather than against the
program that did it: the search's distance array, and the four arrays
as the emission, the assignment and the kill leave them. Nothing here
knows about the machine, and the walk below owes exactly these
hypotheses. -/

/-- **One centre.** The search from the centre at position `c` in the
current mask, the block it emits, the assignment it records for the
vertices it is the first to catch, and its own death, carry the
invariant one position on.

# Proof strategy

The whole turn rests on two readings of the one distance array, at the
two radii the pass uses. By `masked_step` the search ran in the ambient
arena with the predecessors of the centre isolated, so by the fibre
bridge `D w ≤ 2r` says exactly that the centre is weakly
`2r`-reachable from `w` — the emitted block is the fibre — and
`D w ≤ r` says exactly that the centre *catches* `w`.

The block clauses are then bookkeeping: the earlier blocks lie below
the old write pointer and are untouched, and the new one is the range
the emission filled. The mask clause is the rank of the centre being
`c`, so that "killed" grows from `rk < c` to `rk < c + 1`. And the two
assignment clauses swap roles exactly once per vertex: a vertex with no
catcher passed either finds one now, in which case the centre's rank
`c` is minimal among all catchers because none below `c` catches it, or
does not, in which case the only new candidate rank — `c` itself, since
ranks are injective — has just been ruled out. -/

/-! ### The program

Six phases, of which one is a whole other program: the search of
`Lax3Proofs.RamBfs`, run once per centre in the mask the pass has
whittled down so far. Everything else is a flat pass.

The two radii the emission tests against are literals, as the search's
cap is: a radius in this submission comes from the formula and not from
the input, so `coverCom` is a family of programs, one per radius, and
nothing downstream passes a radius at run time. The *order* is input,
and it arrives as one array — `ord c` is the vertex the ordering puts
at position `c`. The rank array the elimination engine also produces is
not read at all; it enters only the proof, as the ordering `π`. -/

/-- Mark every vertex unassigned: the assignment array gets the
sentinel `n`, which is the one value that is not a position. -/

/-- One vertex of the emission scan, and the whole of what the pass
does with the search's answer. A vertex within `2r` of the centre goes
into the centre's block. A vertex within `r` of it — the sharper test,
made on the same distance — is *caught*, and if nothing has caught it
yet the centre's position is recorded as its assignment. The order of
the two tests is the algorithm: the assignment records **first**
catches, and it is that, not the catching, that the covering argument
needs. -/

/-! ### The specification

Four arrays in, three arrays out, and one scalar. The block structure
and the ambient mask are the arena; the order array is the ordering the
elimination engine computed, and the *rank* array it also computed is
not read at all — it enters only as the permutation `π` of the proof,
tied to the order array by `OrdersBy`.

The pass writes into the ambient mask, killing each centre as it goes,
so a caller that still wants the arena afterwards keeps its own copy.
That is the one destructive thing it does. -/

/-- **The same surface with the target array widened** (rebase F-c-3):
the block structure's targets are materialized at a caller-chosen width
`nt`, the call's slot count `ns` being only a lower bound.
`RamElim.ElimPreW` is the precedent and the reason is the same one — a
caller that runs several passes on graphs it materializes itself
allocates `tgt` once and cannot re-allocate it, an IMP+ run being unable
to change the length of an array. Everything this pass *addresses* is
still below `O n = ns`: the search scans rows, and a row ends at an
offset.

The slot count is carried as a parameter and constrains no clause here
— it is `ImplementsW` that asks `ns ≤ nt` — so that a caller reads the
two widths of one surface off one parameter list. `CoverPre` is the
case `nt = ns`, clause for clause. -/

/-- **The state the loop runs against**: the invariant of the pass,
carried by the four arrays it writes, with the arrays it only reads
frozen and the two scratch arrays of the search at their lengths. The
counter and the write pointer are read off the environment, so that the
loop rule owns them.

**The three word clauses.** The bounded semantics has no value for a
cell at or above the word bound, and the pass reads three arrays whose
cells nothing else here pins: the mask `alv`, whose first read is the
search's own `.get "alv" (.var "src")` — `CoverInv.mask` says only which
of its cells are *zero* — the distance array `dist`, read at every
vertex by the emission scan while the search characterizes it only below
the cap, and (ledger P1/B-d) the search's other scratch array `q`, whose
*entering* cells the tower export asks to be words because `Ir.StateBound`
is state-global. Without the first `Implements` below is refuted by the
state whose mask holds `B` at its single vertex, which `CoverInv`
tolerates and the semantics does not. All three are preserved by any
bounded run, so carrying them costs a line per turn — and every caller
has them: at the driver they are `RamDriver.LevelMem`'s own conjuncts. -/

Everything that triple's postcondition *means* is proved above,
unconditionally. `CoverInv.step` is the turn's mathematics — and its
hypothesis `hD` is the search specification's threshold postcondition
verbatim, at the source `ord c` and the cap `2r`, so the composition
against the search is an application and not an argument. What is left
inside this triple is symbolic execution: the source load, the search
(`Refine.BfsBridge.bfsQCom_spec`), the emission scan (`Spec.forRangeZero` over the
vertices, its body the three-way conditional of `emitSlot`), the kill,
and the two commands that close the block. The bounds they need are the
array lengths of `CoverState` and the word bound; the cluster arena
never overflows because the write pointer is at most `c * n` after `c`
centres, which is a clause of the invariant. -/

/-- **The same obligation at the widened target array** (rebase F-c-3).
Two hypotheses join the four: `hnt : ns ≤ nt`, and the padding clause
`hpad` — every slot of the array above the structure's own holds a
vertex. `hpad` is **not** an artefact of this file: it is the residual
of the tower's F-a decoupling, whose `BfsQ.Shape` keeps its range
clause over the whole physical array because `Ir.StateBound` is
state-global (`Refine.BfsBridge.csr_of_csrGraphW` carries the note).
The pass reads the target array only through the search, so this is the
only place the padding is seen.

`Implements` is the case `nt = ns`, where `hpad` is vacuous.

**The padding clause is guarded by `0 < n`** (rebase F-c-4). A level's
target array is `W` cells with a *zero* tail, not a tail of vertices,
because the range form is unsatisfiable at `n = 0` — `RamDriver.LevelPre`
records the refutation. Zero yields `T j < n` exactly when `n` is
positive, and a turn always has `σ.vars "c" < n` and so does; the guard
is where that reading is taken. Nothing else moves: the clause is
consumed at one place, the search inside the turn. -/

/-- **The cover pass of Grohe–Kreutzer–Siebertz §6.** Handed a block
structure for `G`, an ambient mask, and the order array of an ordering
`π`, `coverCom r` leaves in `xoff`/`xmem` the fibres of weak
`2r`-reachability under `π`, one block per centre in the order's own
order, and in `asg` a map sending every vertex to a block whose cluster
contains its whole `r`-ball. Those are the covering and the radius
conditions of an `r`-neighborhood cover of radius `2r`; the third, the
degree, is the ordering's own weak reachability bound, which
`isNeighborhoodCover_of_out` takes as input and no program computes.

# Proof strategy

The loop is `Spec.forRangeZero` over the positions of the order, run
against `CoverStateW`; `CoverInv.init` is what the three commands before
it establish, `ImplementsW` is one turn, and `CoverInv.out` — through
`coverPost_of_stateW` — is what the exit `c = n` gives. The fill that
clears the assignments is the kit's array pass with the sentinel `n` as
its cell function, and the two commands that open the cluster arena are
walked in place.

**Rebase F-c-3: the walk is written at the widened width.** Nothing in
it reads the target array — the search does, and it enters through the
turn obligation — so `nt` travels from the precondition to the loop
state and nowhere else. `cover_spec` is this at `nt = ns`.

**Rebase E-mem/W1: the turn arrives as a `Spec`, not as `ImplementsW`.**
The assembly reads exactly two things off the value bound — `n < B`, for
the loop's own counter comparison, and the turn triple — and nothing
else in it mentions the arena. Taking the triple as a parameter is what
lets the same assembly be run at the landed carrier bound
(`cover_specW`, below, unchanged) and at
`RamDriver.WordBoundK`'s arena bound
(`Refine.CoverWidth.coverPass_specKW`), with the walk written once. -/

/-! ### The worked example

House discipline: what the specification says is also *seen*. The graph
is the path `0—1—2—3` with an isolated vertex `4`, the ordering is the
identity, the ambient mask is all-alive, and the radius is `1`, so the
clusters are the fibres of weak `2`-reachability.

Hand computation: the centre `0` reaches back two steps, so its fibre
is `{0, 1, 2}`; the centre `1` is `π`-minimal on a walk from `2` or `3`
but not from `0`, so its fibre is `{1, 2, 3}`; likewise `{2, 3}` and
`{3}`; and the isolated `4` has `{4}`. The assignment records first
catches at radius `1`, so `0` and `1` are claimed by centre `0`, `2` by
centre `1`, `3` by centre `2`, and `4` by centre `4` — and each
vertex's whole `1`-ball is inside the cluster it names, which is what
the specification promises. -/

/-! ### The widening, differentially (rebase F-c-3)

`cover_specW` claims that materializing the target array wider than the
block structure occupies changes nothing the pass computes. That is a
claim about *runs*, so it is checked on runs: the same graph, the same
ordering, the same radii — and two more slots written past the
structure's six, holding vertices the structure never names.

The check is the F-a pattern: the padded run's answers are compared to
the exact run's cell by cell, at all four settings of the worked
example. Only the clock moves, by the two extra stores. -/

/-! **Refuted: the padding hypothesis is not redundant.** `hpad` is not
implied by the block structure — `RamBfs.CsrGraph G ns O T` constrains
`T` only below the slot count `ns = 6`, so a target function agreeing
with the demo's there and holding a non-vertex above it satisfies every
clause of `CsrGraph` and none of `hpad`. That is why
`csr_of_csrGraphW` asks for it separately, and it is F-a's own residual
(`BfsQ.Shape`'s range clause runs over the whole physical array). -/
