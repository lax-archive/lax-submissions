Neighborhood covers out of a vertex ordering: the construction behind
Theorem 6.2 of Grohe–Kreutzer–Siebertz, via their Lemma 6.9.

Fix any ordering `π` of the vertices whose weak `2r`-reachability sets
have size at most `k`. The cluster of a vertex `u` is the fiber of weak
`2r`-reachability
over `u` — the set of vertices `w` from which `u` is weakly `2r`-reachable.
Three readings of that one definition give the three conditions of a
neighborhood cover. Its *degree* is the wreach bound read backwards: the
clusters containing a fixed `v` are indexed by exactly the vertices weakly
`2r`-reachable from `v`, so there are at most `k` of them. Its
*radius* is the length bound on the reachability walk, reversed. And it
*covers*: the `r`-ball of `v` is contained in the cluster of the
`π`-minimal vertex `u` of that ball, because any `w` in the ball reaches
`u` by going back to `v` and out again — a walk of length at most `2r`
whose support stays inside the ball, where `u` is minimal by choice.

This proves `Lax3.OrderedNeighborhoodCover.isNeighborhoodCover_wreach`,
the core used for the algorithm's computed ordering. The existential
cover theorem chooses an ordering attaining `wcol G (2r)` and applies
that concept claim with `k = wcol G (2r)`.

conclusion: Lax3.OrderedNeighborhoodCover.isNeighborhoodCover_wreach
---
**The cover of an ordering** (Lemma 6.9 of Grohe–Kreutzer–Siebertz,
the parametric core of their Theorem 6.2). For any ordering `π` whose
weak `2r`-reachability sets have at most `k` elements, the fibers of weak
`2r`-reachability form an `r`-neighborhood cover of radius `2r` and
degree at most `k`.

# Proof strategy

For the supplied ordering `π`, let the cluster of
`u` be `{w | u ∈ wreach G π (2r) w}`, the set of vertices from which `u`
is weakly `2r`-reachable.

The degree bound is the definition read backwards: the set of clusters
containing `v` is indexed by `{u | u ∈ wreach G π (2r) v}`, which is
`wreach G π (2r) v` itself, of size at most `k` by hypothesis.
The radius bound drops the minimality clause: a vertex in the cluster
of `u` reaches `u` by a walk of length at most `2r`, which reversed puts
it in the `2r`-ball of `u`.

Covering is the only real argument. Given `v`, let `u` be a `π`-minimal
vertex of the `r`-ball of `v`, which is nonempty and finite. For `w` in
that ball, concatenate the reversed ball walk `w → v` with the ball walk
`v → u`: a walk of length at most `2r` from `w` to `u`. Every vertex on it
lies on one of the two halves, and cutting a walk of length at most `r` at
any of its vertices shows that vertex to be within distance `r` of both
endpoints — so the whole support stays inside the `r`-ball of `v`, where
`u` is `π`-minimal. Hence `u` is weakly `2r`-reachable from `w`, i.e. `w`
lies in the cluster of `u`.

conclusion: Lax3.NeighborhoodCoverBound.exists_neighborhoodCover_degree_wcol
---
**Neighborhood covers of weak coloring degree** (Theorem 6.2 of
Grohe–Kreutzer–Siebertz, via their Lemma 6.9): every graph has, for every
radius `r`, an `r`-neighborhood cover of radius `2r` whose degree is at
most its weak `2r`-coloring number.

# Proof strategy

Choose an ordering attaining `wcol G (2r)`: the defining infimum is over
a nonempty set of natural-number bounds, so it is attained. Apply
`Lax3.OrderedNeighborhoodCover.isNeighborhoodCover_wreach` to that
ordering and its bound. The arbitrary-order construction is discharged
by `isNeighborhoodCover_wreach` above.
