/-!
The *isolation rewrite*: a purely syntactic translation `iso` of
distance logic that trades the edges incident to a batch of vertices for
recorded distance colors, so that truth over an arena is truth of the
translated formula over the isolated arena, at **every** tuple and with
no side condition on where the tuple sits.

# The setting

The arena is a colored graph `(A, col)` on `Fin n`. The batch is an
enumeration `w : Fin m' → Fin n`; the batch *set* is `Set.range w`, and
the isolated arena is `deleteVerts A (Set.range w)` — Lax199508's isolation
move, which drops every edge incident to the batch and keeps the
carrier, so vertices persist and equality needs no readout at all.

What the isolated arena loses is exactly the metric information carried
by walks through the batch. That information is recorded as colors of an
extended palette `Fin L'`, addressed by three slot maps that the
translation takes as parameters:

* `old c` — where the old color `c` now lives;
* `pd j a` — the *cumulative profile* slot, holding `{v | dist(v, w j) ≤ a}`;
* `pu c b` — the *cumulative color-distance* slot, holding
  `{v | ∃ y ∈ col c, dist(v, y) ≤ b}`.

Both profile families are capped: their distance index runs over
`Fin (cap + 1)`, and the translation is correct on the formulas whose
radii all stay below `cap`, which is the predicate `RadiiLe`. No
injectivity and no disjointness is assumed anywhere — the correctness
lemma only assumes that the new coloring interprets the three slot
families as just described, so a consumer is free to pack them into
`Fin L'` however it likes.

# The translation, atom by atom

Equality and color atoms are unchanged (up to `old`). The remaining
atoms each get a disjunction, written with the derived connectives `or`
and `bigOr` of this file, since `DistFO` has no primitive disjunction:

* `adj i j` becomes "adjacent in the isolated arena, or distinct and
  joined through a batch vertex at profile distances `0` and `1`". The
  distinctness conjunct is load-bearing: without it the pair
  `(w j, w j)` would be accepted by the `0`/`0` reading of the profile
  slots.
* `distLe d i j` becomes "within `d` in the isolated arena, or joined
  through a batch vertex by two legs of recorded lengths adding up to at
  most `d`".
* `distColorLt r c i` is answered outright by a single color atom: the
  slot `pu c (r - 1)` already holds the vertices at distance less than
  `r` from the color class *in the original arena*, so no disjunction
  and no metric reasoning is needed. At `r = 0` the atom is
  unsatisfiable and the translation is falsity.

Connectives are structural, and so is unrestricted quantification.

# The metric kernel

Everything metric reduces to
`Lax3Proofs.WalkDistance.withinDist_deleteVerts_or_through`: a walk of
length at most `d` either avoids the batch, and then survives isolation
whole, or it meets the batch and splits there into two legs whose
lengths add up to at most `d`. Packaged here as
`withinDist_iff_deleteVerts_or_through`, an equivalence between being
within `d` in the arena and the disjunction "within `d` after isolation,
or `Through` the batch". The converse direction is the triangle
inequality plus the fact that isolation only removes edges.

# As-built deviation from design record §(a): the two-case local quantifier

The design record translates a local quantifier by turning its guard
into distance atoms inside the body and degrading the quantifier to an
unrestricted one, claiming that distance rank is preserved. **It is
not.** A guard of a formula of distance rank `(k', q + 1)` is allowed
radius up to `ρ⁺(k' + 1, q)`, while a binary distance atom sitting
inside that quantifier's body — which has rank `(k' + 1, q)` — is
allowed only `ρ⁻(k' + 1, q)`, and `ρ⁻(k' + 1, q) < ρ⁺(k' + 1, q)`. The
guard radius therefore does not fit into the body, and the rewriting
loses the rank the whole locality schedule is built on.

The translation here avoids the gap by splitting into two cases:

    exL r g φ  ↦  exL r g (iso φ)  ∨  exU (isoGuard r g ∧ iso φ)

Case 1 keeps a genuine local quantifier at the *same* radius `r`, so its
`DRank.exL` side condition is the input's unchanged. Case 2 is an
unrestricted quantifier whose guard `isoGuard` is built from **color
atoms only** — the profile slots — and color atoms carry every distance
rank, so `DRank.exU` needs nothing beyond the body's rank. Both cases
preserve distance rank exactly, and their disjunction is the intended
meaning: a witness guarded within `r` of the guard set is either
guarded within `r` *after* isolation, or reached through a batch vertex,
which is what the profile colors record. The empty guard set needs no
special treatment: it makes the source quantifier unsatisfiable and the
case-2 guard an empty disjunction, that is falsity.

Three smaller as-built notes. First, `sat_iso` carries the hypothesis
`1 ≤ cap`: the adjacency case reads the profile slot at distance `1`,
which does not exist when `cap = 0`, and no translation of an adjacency
atom can be correct when the recorded profiles see distance `0` only.
Every rank-driven instantiation supplies it for free, see
`one_le_cap_of_rhoMinus_le`. Second, out-of-range distance indices are
*clamped* rather than sent to falsity (`profIdx`); which of the two is
chosen is immaterial, since `RadiiLe cap` keeps every index in range at
every place the correctness lemma looks. Third, the guard set of a local
quantifier is enumerated by filtering `List.finRange`, not by
`Finset.toList`, which is noncomputable — the translation is meant to be
run by the evaluator, so `iso` is kept computable.

# Formalization notes

No tactic here is handed a concept-side definition: `Sat`, `DistFO`,
`DRank`, `WithinDist`, `deleteVerts`, `rhoMinus` and `rhoPlus` are taken
apart through the clause lemmas of `Lax3Proofs.SyntaxLemmas`, through
the walk lemmas of `Lax3Proofs.WalkDistance`, through the inequality kit
of `Lax3Proofs.Horizon`, or definitionally by `exact`. The definitions
introduced here — `or`, `bigOr`, `falsum`, `RadiiLe`, `iso` and its
pieces — are of course unfolded freely, and their `rfl`-lemmas are
recorded in this namespace.

`radiiLe_of_drank` reads the cap off a rank derivation. Its two
hypotheses are the two horizons of the *outer* rank: `ρ⁻(k', q)` bounds
the distance atoms and `ρ⁺(k' + 1, q - 1)` bounds the guards — the
latter because `DRank.exL` concludes rank `(k', q₀ + 1)` from a guard
bound at `q₀`. The induction descends through both, and needs only the
antidiagonal monotonicities already in `Lax3Proofs.Horizon`.

/-! ### Reading the cap off a distance rank

A formula of distance rank `(k', q)` has its distance atoms bounded by
ρ⁻(k', q) and its guards by ρ⁺(k'+1, q−1) — the latter because
`DRank.exL` concludes rank `(k', q₀ + 1)` from a guard bounded at `q₀`.
Both bounds descend along the derivation by the antidiagonal
monotonicities of `Lax3Proofs.Horizon`.
