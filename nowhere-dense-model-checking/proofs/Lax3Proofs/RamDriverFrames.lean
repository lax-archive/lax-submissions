/-!
The scatter phase of a cluster, and the two frames of a turn.

Two of `Lax3Proofs.RamDriverCluster`'s obligations are discharged here:
the frame conditions `InnerFrames` and `ClusterFrames`, which no syntax
can supply because both commands contain the nested driver, which is a
program *variable*.

**Wave R1.8-T3-flip (c1d).** `RamDriverCluster.ScatterStep` used to be
the third, at the fold of `RamScatter.scatterCom`; it is now stated at
the fold of `RamDriver.scatterDeadCom` and its discharge is
`Refine.ScatterDeadTurn.scatterDeadStep`, which cannot live here because
the dead-aware passes' walks import `Lax3Proofs.RamDriverCluster`.

**Wave R1.8-T3-flip (c2b).** The landed reading of
`RamDriver.scatterCom`'s fold — `atomCom`/`atom_spec`/`atoms_spec`/
`blocks_spec` — is **deleted**, and so is `RamDriver.scatterCom`: with
the table invariant weakened to `RamDriver.TableInvOn` at
`alive ∪ kills`, `RamScatter.scatter_spec`'s carrier-wide `hTab` is no
longer statable from `ScatPre`, and nothing referenced the chain.

# The scatter phase

`ScatPre` is what the phase carries — the obligation's own precondition,
named once — and `ScatPre.run` is that a call of the phase preserves it:
the pass and the copies write `alv`, `tab` and the search's three scratch
arrays, and none of those is an array the turn pins, since the per-depth
names are prefixed and the fixed ones are elsewhere.

# The frames

`innerFrames` reduces `InnerFrames` to two syntactic questions about
`inner` — that it writes none of `TurnFrozen`'s arrays and assigns none
of four scalars — plus a run of it, which a `Spec` needs and which no
frame can produce.

`clusterFrames` runs the six phases and reads the two clauses off their
postconditions: `RamDriverCluster.CoverHeld` crosses the turn because
every one of the five obligations carries `RamDriverCluster.TurnPre`,
and the table clause is the readback's own, moved back to the turn's
entry by `tabName_notMem_warrs_turn` — that the descent, the padding,
the colouring and the scatter phase write no table.

# What the driver used to owe

The three conjuncts this file once carried as hypotheses are now in the
surface, and all three theorems consume them from it.

* `hcolread` is gone from the scatter phase's obligation and from
  `RamDriverBase.readbackStep`: `RamDriverCluster.ScatterStep` and
  `ReadbackStep` carry the palette equation — and the bit clause beside
  it — in their own preconditions, which is where
  `RamDriverCluster.ColourStep` leaves them.
* `hplay` is gone from `clusterFrames`: `RamDriverCluster.ClusterFrames`
  now takes the same hypothesis about `inner` that
  `RamDriver.ClusterStepImplements` takes, and `RamDriver.PlayRec` — the
  recorded play — is a conjunct of `RamDriverCluster.TurnPre`, so the
  turn can run the nested call and hand the record back.
* `hA`, `hV` in `innerFrames` and `hinnerTab` in `clusterFrames` are now
  *true* of `RamDriver.driverAt … (j + 1)`. The clash they recorded is
  repaired at the program: the ordering pass writes `ordName j`, the
  cover's answers are copied into `xofName j`, `xmmName j`, `asgName j`
  and `xpName j` by `RamDriver.coverSave`, and the centre cursor is
  `curName j`. A nested level touches none of them, so `TurnFrozen` and
  the four scalar side conditions are frame conditions of the recursion
  and not obstructions to it.

/-! ### The generated names

Every per-depth name of the driver is a literal prefix followed by a
decimal numeral, and the flags carry two. What a walk over the scatter
phase needs of them is that they are none of the five arrays the phase
writes, and that the flags are addressed injectively — the first because
the separator does not occur in a decimal representation, the second
because the representation is injective. Both come off
`RamDriverBase`'s kit. -/

/-- The arrays the calling convention and the scatter pass write.

**Wave R1.8-T3-flip (c1d)**: `"mem"` and `"qd"` join the five, because
the dead-aware atom phase runs `Refine.ScatterBlock.scatBlockCom`, whose
working set they are. Both are fixed names of a sub-program, so no
clause `ScatPre` pins is one of them — `RamDriver.memName_ne_mem` is the
only near miss and it is a disequality. -/

/-- **The generated evaluator's scratch, as this file can name it.**
`RamDriverBot.Ext "bb"` unfolded — `RamDriverBot` sits beside this file
in the import order, not below it, so the predicate is restated rather
than imported. It is *definitionally* `RamDriverBot.Ext "bb"`, so a
consumer above both may hand one for the other. -/

**Wave R1.8-T3-flip (c2b): the landed phase is gone.** `ScatPre` now
carries `RamDriver.TableInvOn` at `alive ∪ kills`, and
`RamScatter.scatter_spec` — the call `RamDriver.scatterCom`'s atom made —
asks for the atom's row at *every* carrier vertex, dead ones included.
So `atomCom`, `atom_spec`, `atoms_spec`, `blocks_spec` and the
`ScatPre.tab` accessor were not weakened but **deleted**: nothing
referenced them once `RamDriverCluster.ScatterStep` moved to the fold of
`RamDriver.scatterDeadCom` (wave (c1d)), and with the invariant flipped
they are no longer provable at all. `RamDriver.scatterCom` went with
them. `Refine.ScatterDeadTurn.scatterDeadStep` is the successor. -/

/-! ### The frames of the turn's other four phases

`RamDriverCluster.ClusterFrames` asks, on top of the cover's answers,
that a turn leave the depth-`j` table cells of the vertices it is *not*
writing alone. The readback's own obligation says that of the readback;
what is owed here is that the four phases before it write no table at
all. Their write sets are folds — the expansion chain, the ancestor
loop, the three slot families — so each is one induction over the fold
plus the pieces' own syntax, and the conclusion is read off the names: a
table name carries the separator, and every array the descent, the
padding and the scatter phase write is a literal or a prefixed name
without one, while every array the colouring writes is a colour name,
whose prefix is not a table's. -/

/-! ### What the nested call must leave alone

`RamDriverCluster.InnerFrames` is a specification of `inner`, and `inner`
is a program *variable*: nothing whatever follows about it from the
obligation's own text. Two things have to be handed in.

*The call itself.* A `Spec` is total correctness, so the frame cannot be
proved without a run of `inner`; `hinner` is the nested level's own
specification — `RamDriverCluster.InnerAvail`, which is exactly the
antecedent `RamDriver.ClusterStepImplements` and
`RamDriverCluster.ClusterFrames` carry. It is used twice: for the run,
and for its *postcondition*, which is `RamDriver.LevelPost` at depth
`j + 1` and therefore hands back everything a level owns —
the block structure, the two scalars, `RamDriver.LevelMem`,
`RamDriver.DepthMem`, `RamDriver.OrderMem` with its eight zeroed
accumulators, and the depth-`(j+1)` masks and palette. **Wave E2**: that
is why those are no longer frame conditions. They cannot be: the nested
level runs `RamDriver.orderCom`, which writes every one of the eight,
and `RamDriverBot.Ext`-fresh names besides, so `TurnFrozen` asking for
them was refutable at `RamDriver.driverAt (j+1)`.

The bit clause `InnerAvail` needs of the palette is the ninth conjunct
of `RamDriver.LevelPre` at depth `j + 1`, which `InnerFrames`'s own
precondition carries — so nothing has to be handed in for it, and the
whole family `hinner` can be applied under the obligation's `intro`.

*The frame itself.* `TurnFrozen` is what is left: the arrays of the
enclosing turn's *own* depth (and the game masks of the depths below,
for the recorded play), which a level at depth `j + 1` does not write
because its per-depth names are all at depth `j + 1` or above. That is
`Lax3Proofs.RamDriverWrites.belowArr_notMem_warrs_driverAt`, and the
three scalars are its scalar half. -/

/-- The arrays the enclosing turn is still holding while the nested
driver runs: the cover's three answers and the depth's order array, the
two masks and the palette of the depth, the cluster's own three, and the
game masks of the depths below — every one of them a name of a depth at
or below `j`, hence one the level at depth `j + 1` does not write. -/
def TurnFrozen (j : ℕ) (a : String) : Prop :=
  a ∈ [alvName j, cluName j, resName j, batName j,
      ordName j, xofName j, xmmName j, asgName j, memName j, klName j] ∨
    (∃ c, a = colName j c) ∨ (∃ b ≤ j, a = gamName b)

/-- **The frame of the nested driver, discharged from its syntax.**

**Wave R1.8-T3-flip (c1c): the kill list crosses too.** The atom pass
reads `klName j`/`kkName j` *after* the recursion returns — that is the
whole reason `RamDriver.killListCom` writes a per-depth name — so
`RamDriverCluster.KillListAt` is now a clause of `InnerFrames` on both
sides. The array joins `TurnFrozen` above and the count takes the new
scalar hypothesis `hVkk`; both are
`RamDriverWrites.belowArr_notMem_warrs_driverAt` / `…belowVar…` at the
recursion, which is why `RamDriverWrites.BelowArr`/`BelowVar` gained the
two names in the same wave. -/

/-! ### What one turn leaves alone

`RamDriverCluster.ClusterFrames` is not a frame of the turn's syntax:
`inner` is a variable, and the second clause is about what the *readback*
wrote. So it is discharged the way the turn's own obligation is —
by running the six phases — with three things added.

*The cover's answers* need no frame at all: every one of the five
obligations carries `RamDriverCluster.TurnPre` in its postcondition, and
so does `RamDriverCluster.InnerFrames`, so `RamDriverCluster.CoverHeld`
crosses the turn by itself.

*The tables* need the four phases before the readback to write none, and
that is `tabName_notMem_warrs_turn` above together with `hinnerTab` — the
one clause the nested call cannot be asked for by `InnerFrames`, whose
postcondition says nothing about the depth's tables.

*The nested call's frame* is built here rather than handed in
(**wave E2**): `RamDriverCluster.InnerFrames` is a `Spec` of the nested
driver, so producing it needs that driver's termination, which is
exactly the `hinner` this obligation carries as an *antecedent*. A
caller doing the downward induction has `hinner` at every depth and
cannot have `InnerFrames` before it, so the hypothesis has to sit under
the `intro` — and it does: what is taken here is `innerFrames`'
syntactic side, and the semantic side comes from `hinner`. -/
