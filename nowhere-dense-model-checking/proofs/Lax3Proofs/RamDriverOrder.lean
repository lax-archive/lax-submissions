/-! ### The word clauses the cover pass's invariant omits

`RamCover.CoverState` pins the four arrays the pass writes and the
three it reads, but says of no array that its cells are *words*. Three
of them have to be, and none follows from anything the invariant
carries.

* `alv` is read by the search — its very first act is
  `.get "alv" (.var "src")` — so the search's `halv` is asked of
  the mask the turn runs against, which is `A₀` with some cells zeroed
  and therefore *not* pinned by `RamCover.CoverInv.mask`: that clause
  says only which cells are zero.
* `dist` is read by the emission scan, at every vertex, and the
  search's postcondition characterizes its cells only *below the cap*
  — a cell holding the sentinel is left unbounded, even though the fill
  in fact put `2r + 1` there.
* `q`, since rebase P1, because the tower export's `Ir.StateBound` is
  state-global: it asks the *entering* cells of both scratch arrays to
  be words, where the hand-walked baseline bounded only what its run
  evaluated (ledger P1/B-d).

All three are `∀ v ∈ σ.arrs a, v < B`, the shape `RamDriver.LevelMem`
already uses, and all three are preserved by *any* bounded run
(`RamDriver.run_mem_arrs_lt`), so carrying them costs one line per
phase. At the driver they are free: `RamDriver.LevelMem` is the `dist`
and `q` halves verbatim and `RamDriver.LevelPre`'s `∀ z < n, M z < B`
becomes the `alv` half the moment `RamDriver.copyCom` has run.

The consequence for the surface is recorded at `coverTurnImplements`. -/

array and — since the tower search's precondition is state-global
(ledger P1/B-d) — the search's other scratch array all hold words. -/

/-! ### The emission scan

`RamCover.emitLoop` walks the carrier once, reading the one distance
array at the two radii of the pass. `EmitInv` is what it carries: the
cluster arena filled from the entering write pointer `xp₀` up to the
current one, holding exactly the vertices *below the counter* that the
search put within `2r`, and the assignment array rewritten at exactly
the vertices below the counter, by the rule
`RamCover.CoverInv.step`'s `hasg` names.

At the exit the counter is the carrier's size and the three clauses are
`RamCover.CoverInv.step`'s `hkeep`, `hblock` and `hasg` verbatim. -/

/-- **The cell the scan leaves behind it.** A vertex some earlier centre
has already claimed keeps its claim; an unclaimed one the current centre
catches records the centre's position; and an unclaimed one it does not
catch keeps the sentinel. This is `RamCover.CoverInv.step`'s `hasg`,
named. -/

/-- **One vertex of the emission scan.** The distance is read once and
tested at the two radii: the wider test emits into the cluster arena,
the sharper one records a first catch. The four cases of the walk are
the four the invariant's two rewritten clauses distinguish.

**The two ceilings are different ceilings** (rebase E-mem/W1). The scan
forms one pointer *value*, `xp`, and writes into one *array*, `xmem`,
and the two obligations that creates are separate:

* `hbB : xp₀ + n < B` is the **value** bound — every pointer the scan
  forms, up to the `n` slots one block may add, must be a word, because
  the bounded semantics has no value at or above `B`. It used to be read
  off `n * n < B`, the carrier ceiling `RamCover.CoverInv.ptr_le` paid
  for; `Refine.ArenaWidth.block_scan_lt` now supplies it from
  `CoverInv.ptr_le_mass` and `WordBoundK`, at `n * d` instead
  (`Refine.ArenaPointer`).
* `hxp₀ : xp₀ + n ≤ n * n` is the **allocation** bound — the store index
  must be inside the array, whose length is `n * n`. Nothing here
  changes it and nothing should: the arena is still `n × n` cells, and
  `Refine.ArenaWidth` §1 is the reason that costs the word length
  nothing.

`n < B` was a consequence of the old `n * n < B`; it is now carried
explicitly, since the block-scan bound does not give it when the pass has
emitted nothing. -/

/-! ### One turn of the cover pass

The walk `RamCover.Implements` asks for: the source load, the search,
the emission scan, the kill, and the two commands that close the block.
Everything the turn's postcondition *means* is `RamCover.CoverInv.step`,
which is landed; what is here is the execution between the search's
postcondition and that step's hypotheses.

The two frames the composition needs are read off the syntax: the
search writes only its own scratch, and the emission scan only the
arena and the assignment. Both lists are computed by `rfl`, since
`Com.wvars` and `Com.warrs` do not look at the expressions and so are
concrete lists even at a symbolic radius.

Since rebase P1 the search is the refinement tower's synthesized queue
BFS behind `Refine.BfsBridge.bfsQCom`, whose bridge lemma
`Refine.BfsBridge.bfsQCom_spec` is `RamBfs.bfs_spec`'s statement
verbatim but for the two extra word clauses of ledger P1/B-d. The
arrays it writes are the same two, in the same order; the scalars it
writes are the tower's own sixteen, so `bfsQCom_wvars` grows and three
of its entries — `dv1`, `v1`, `k0` — carry a digit, which
`RamDriverWrites.belowVar_notMem_wvars_coverPhase` has to be told about
(ledger P1/B-f, recorded there). -/

theorem bfsQCom_wvars (d : ℕ) : (Refine.BfsBridge.bfsQCom d).wvars =
    ["sent", "d", "one", "i", "head", "a", "tl", "v", "dv", "dv1", "k0", "v1", "kend",
      "u", "au", "du",
      "i", "a", "tl", "tl", "v", "dv", "head", "dv1", "k0", "v1", "kend", "u", "au",
      "du", "tl", "k0"] := rfl

theorem bfsQCom_warrs (d : ℕ) : (Refine.BfsBridge.bfsQCom d).warrs =
    ["dist", "dist", "q", "dist", "q"] := rfl

theorem emitLoop_wvars (r : ℕ) : (RamCover.emitLoop r).wvars = ["z", "dz", "xp", "z"] := rfl

/-! **The one value bound the turn takes off the arena** (rebase
E-mem/W1, moved E-mem/W2). At every state the cover loop can be in —
that is, at every state whose arena satisfies `RamCover.CoverInv`, below
the last centre — the widest pointer the emission scan will form,
`xp + n`, is a word. That is `RamDriver.PtrWords`, and it is a
*predicate* and not an inequality because the pointer is not a parameter
of the walk: it is read off the state the turn starts in, so the ceiling
has to be quantified over the invariant. There are exactly two ways to
supply it, and they are the before and after of the width repair:

* the carrier reading — `CoverInv.ptr_le : xp ≤ c * n` with `c < n`,
  against `n * n + … < B` (`RamDriver.ptrWords_of_square`), which is what
  the landed `RamCover.Implements` slot pays for;
* the arena reading — `CoverInv.ptr_le_mass : xp ≤ n * d` against
  `RamDriver.WordBoundK` at the ordering's weak-reachability degree,
  which is `Refine.ArenaPointer.block_scan_lt`, is consumed in
  `Refine.CoverWidth`, and is what `RamDriverRoot` supplies since W3.

The **allocation** clause `xp + n ≤ n * n` is not part of it and does not
move: it is about the length of the `xmem` list, which the word length
never reads (`Refine.ArenaWidth` §1), and the walk derives it from
`ptr_le` either way.

The slot itself lives beside the value bound in `RamDriver`, because
`RamDriver.CoverImplements` — the phase obligation, which is below this
file — takes it. It is re-exported here, where its walk is. -/

export Lax3Proofs.RamDriver (PtrWords ptrWords_of_square)

/-- **One centre, at a target array materialized wider than the block
structure occupies** (rebase F-c-3). The source load, the search, the
emission scan, the kill, and the two commands that close the block —
the same five, at `RamCover.CoverStateW`.

The width reaches exactly two lines of the walk: the search enters
through `Refine.BfsBridge.bfsQCom_specW` instead of its pinned
instance, and the `tgt` clause is carried across the search and the
emission scan (`b9`, `c4`) as the opaque frame it always was. Nothing
addressed moves — the search scans rows, and a row ends at an offset —
so the cost is still read at the slot count `ns`.

**Rebase E-mem/W1: the value bound enters as `PtrWords`.** The walk used
to derive `n < B`, `ns < B`, `2r + 1 < B` and the emission scan's
pointer ceiling from the single hypothesis `n * n + ns + 2 * r + 2 < B`.
Only the last of the four is about the arena, and it is the only one the
width repair touches; the other three are read off whichever value bound
the caller carries. `centreStep_specW` is this at the landed one, and
`Refine.CoverWidth` runs the same walk at `WordBoundK`.

`centreStep_spec` is this at `nt = ns`. -/

/-! ### The obligation, and the repair it names

`RamCover.Implements` is exactly this walk: the three word clauses are
now conjuncts of `RamCover.CoverState` itself, and they are there
because without them the obligation is **refutable**.

The mask clause is the sharp one. Take `n = 1`, `A₀ 0 = 1`, and a mask
array holding `B` at the single vertex: every other clause of
`RamCover.CoverState` holds, since its only statement about the mask —
`RamCover.CoverInv.mask` — says which cells are *zero* and this one is
not; and the search's first read of `alv` at the source then has no
bounded evaluation, so `RamCover.centreStep` has no `Run` from that
state at all and the `Spec` is false.

The `dist` clause is a gap of a different kind. The cells really are
words — the search's fill writes `2r + 1` into all of them before the
drain starts, and the drain only lowers them — but the search's
postcondition characterizes the distance array only *below the cap*, so
a cell holding the sentinel is left unbounded and the emission scan's
`.get "dist" (.var "z")` cannot be justified. Carrying it in the
invariant is one line; the alternative — the search specification
gaining `∀ w < n, D w ≤ d + 1` — touches every caller of the search.

The `q` clause is rebase P1's (ledger P1/B-d). It is not a gap at all
but a change of accounting: the tower export's `Ir.StateBound` is
state-global, so the *entering* cells of both scratch arrays have to be
words, where the hand-walked baseline bounded only what its own run
evaluated.

No clause costs the loop anything: all three are preserved by any
bounded run (`RamDriver.run_mem_arrs_lt`), `RamCover.CoverInv.step` and
`CoverInv.out` never mention the environment, and `RamCover.cover_spec`
establishes them at entry from its own `hA` and two hypotheses on
`dist` and `q`, which every caller has — at the driver they are
`RamDriver.LevelMem`'s own conjuncts. `CoverWords` survives above only
as the shorthand this walk carries its three clauses in. -/

application. -/

program, same cost, same `RamCover.CoverPost`, which does not mention
the target array at all. -/

about the arena, and only that one differs between the carrier and the
mass reading. This is the same walk with the three level clauses taken
directly and the arena ceiling taken as `PtrWords`, which is what
`RamDriver.CoverImplements` hands it. `coverPass_specW` is this at
`ptrWords_of_square`; `Refine.CoverWidth.coverPass_specKW` is it at

/-! ### A scan against an arbitrary bound

Every flat pass of the ordering phase is `RamDriver.fillUpto` at a bound
that is *not* a scalar: `n + 1` for the three offset arrays, `m + m` for
the level's own block structure, the literal `W` for the engines'
scratch. `Spec.forRangeZero` compares two scalars and so does not
apply, and `Lax13Proofs.Reasoning.Lib.Fill.loop_spec` and
`RamDriverCluster.fill_spec` both inherit that shape.

`forRangeZero'`, hoisted into `Refine.DriverPrelude`, is the kit's
counted scan with the bound left as an expression the invariant
evaluates, and `fillUpto_spec` is the array pass on top of it. The
context a pass needs — the scalars its bound and its cell expression
read, and the arrays it reads and does not write — enters as one
abstract predicate `Q` with the two closure conditions that say what the
pass writes: the counter `"i"` and the array `a`. That is what makes one
lemma serve the copies, the fills and the re-zeroing tail alike. -/

/-- **A flat pass over a prefix of an array, at an arbitrary bound.**
`Q` is the context the pass runs in: the scalars its bound and its cell
expression read, and the arrays it reads. The two closure conditions
are exactly what the pass writes — the counter and the array — so a
caller instantiates `Q` with its own frozen surface and owes nothing
else. -/

engine leaves a rank array — an injection of the carrier into its own
positions — and `RamDriver.ordCom` writes its inverse into `ord`, which
is what `RamCover.OrdersBy` is. The only content beyond the walk is
that an injection of a finite range into itself is onto, which is what
turns "every vertex has a position" into "every position has a
vertex". -/

/-! ### The block structure, out of the way and back

`RamDriver.saveCsr` and `RamDriver.restoreCsr` are the same two copies
in the two directions, so one lemma serves both.

**The second copy's bound is the live-width scalar** (rebase G2/E1),
and since rebase G2/E2b the scalar's runtime value `lw` is **not** the
allocation width: `RamDriver.OrderMem` pins only `ns ≤ lw ≤ W`, the
copy walks the `lw`-cell *live prefix* of the `W`-cell array, and the
cost reads `14·lw`, not `14·W` — which is the point of the shrink. What
the copy no longer moves it must account for: the postcondition says
the destination's prefix is the source's and its tail is **the
destination's own entry tail**, verbatim. A save is then sound because
the restore needs only the prefix (the phase's writes stay below `lw` —
`chainWidthE ≤ lw` is the R\*-obligation's guard for exactly this), and
a restore re-assembles the full `arrOf W T` from the copied prefix plus
a tail the phase provably never touched (`restoreCsr_spec`'s `hTs`).

The context still carries `σ.vars "m" + σ.vars "m" = ns`, which nothing
here reads any more; it is what carries the scalar across the two
copies, which is the postcondition's `σ'.vars "m" = σ.vars "m"`. The
`"lw"` clause is carried the same way, and re-established in the
postcondition because the phase hands it on to the next copy. -/

first copy at the carrier's own length, the second at the runtime live

/-! ### What is left of the two large walks

The cover pass is complete: `coverTurnImplements` is
`RamCover.Implements` — with the word clauses of `CoverWords`, which
that obligation must gain before it is true at all — and
`coverPass_spec` is `RamCover.cover_spec`'s conclusion with no
hypothesis about the walk left in it.

`Lax3Proofs.RamAugment.Implements` and
`Lax3Proofs.RamDriver.OrderImplements` are the two that are not, and
this file's remaining contribution to them is the flat-pass kit above.
The frontier, pass by pass.

**The round** (`RamAugment.Implements`). Ten passes and one call, of
which the three counting sorts (`outPass`, the prefix sums of
`fratPass` and of `asmPass`) are `forRangeZero'` at a bound that is a
block offset rather than a length, and the four stamped enumerations
(`fratCount`, `fratFill`, `asmRow` twice) are two nested
`Csr.scan`s whose content is that a stamped walk emits each member of
its set exactly once. That last is the file's only genuinely new
mathematics, and `RamAugment.inN_augOr_eq` and
`RamAugment.card_inN_augOr` are what it has to land on; everything else
in `RamAugment` — the arc rule, the assembly identity, the degree
budget — is proved there already. `RamAugment.ElimAvail` closes the one
call outright, at `ns = fratSlots D`, since wave A2's width threading
made `RamElim.ElimPre`'s scratch width a caller's choice.

**The phase** (`RamDriver.OrderImplements`). Seven phases, of which
three are now walked here: `RamDriver.saveCsr` and
`RamDriver.restoreCsr` are `saveCsr_spec`/`restoreCsr_spec`, and the
rank inversion is `ordCom_spec` — which is the only part of the phase
carrying mathematics, and it is the whole of what the postcondition
asks for, since that postcondition names no ordering in particular.
What is left is bookkeeping of one shape: `RamDriver.augRelinkCom`'s
two copies and seven fills, `RamDriver.orderZeroCom`'s eight fills, and
the mask fill before the second elimination are all `fillUpto_spec` and
`copyUpto_spec` at the contexts `RamDriver.OrderMem` provides; the two
`RamElim.elimCom` calls are `RamDriver.ElimAvail`; and the `R` rounds
are `RamDriver.AugAvail` under `foldRange`, collected by
`RamAugment.isAugChain_succ`. The cost `K` is a parameter of the
obligation and is the wave that computes the cover's degree, not this
one.

**The cover phase** (`RamDriver.CoverImplements`). Its surface gap is
repaired — it now takes `RamBfs.CsrGraph G ns O T`, without which its
postcondition spoke about a graph the program had never been told about
and any `G` disagreeing with `O`/`T` refuted it — but the obligation is
no longer one application of `coverPass_spec`, because the phase is no
longer one call. `RamDriver.coverPhase` is the depth's ordering into
`ord`, the depth's mask into `alv`, the pass, and the four copies of
`RamDriver.coverSave` that make the answers the depth's own; the middle
one is `coverPass_spec` (`RamDriver.LevelPre` supplies the mask bound
and `RamDriver.LevelMem` the `dist` and `q` bounds), and the six around it are
`copyUpto_spec` and `copyCom_spec` at contexts `LevelMem` and
`RamDriver.DepthMem` provide. -/
