Transitive–fraternal augmentations and their in-degree bound on nowhere
dense classes.

# The process

An *orientation* of a graph on `Fin n` is recorded by its in-neighbour
finsets `inN : Fin n → Finset (Fin n)`, with no loops and no two-cycles;
`Orients D G` says that the arcs of `D` are exactly the edges of `G`,
each taken in one direction.  One round of the *tight transitive
fraternal augmentation* turns an orientation `D` into an orientation `D'`
that

* keeps every arc of `D`;
* for every transitive link `u → w → v` puts an arc between `u` and `v`;
* for every fraternal link `u → w ← v` puts an arc between `u` and `v`;
* has no other arcs.

The direction of the new arcs is *not* determined: transitive arcs point
forward unless the pair is transitively linked both ways, and fraternal
edges are oriented by whatever rule the consumer likes — the algorithm of
Grohe–Kreutzer–Siebertz orients them by a greedy degeneracy ordering of
the fraternity graph.  Accordingly `AugStep` is a relation, and a run of
the process is a family `D : ℕ → Orientation n` with `IsAugChain G D r`.

# The theorem

`exists_augChain_inDeg_subpolynomial`: for every nowhere dense class `C`,
every number of rounds `r` and every `δ > 0` there is a `c` such that
every subgraph `G` of a member, on `m` vertices, carries an `r`-round
augmentation chain all of whose in-degrees are at most `c · m ^ δ`.

# The proof

Fix an ordering `π` of the vertices attaining `wcol G (2 ^ r)`.  The
*canonical chain* starts from the orientation of `G` by `π` and, at each
round, adds every demanded pair oriented from the `π`-smaller to the
`π`-larger endpoint.  The invariant carried along the chain is that every
arc `u → v` of the `i`-th orientation has `u` weakly `2 ^ i`-reachable
from `v` under `π`: transitive and fraternal links concatenate two walks
of length at most `2 ^ i`, and the weak-reachability side condition
survives the concatenation because the meeting vertex `w` is
`π`-above both ends of a fraternal link and `π`-between the ends of a
transitive one.  In-degrees are then bounded by the size of a weak
reachability set, i.e. by `wcol G (2 ^ r)`, which is subpolynomial on a
nowhere dense class by Lax199508.

The same invariant bounds the back-degree of the *fraternity graph* of
each round under `π`, which is the "moreover" the greedy algorithm needs:
`canonChain_fratGraph_backDegree`.  Together with the unconditional
per-round recursion `inDegLE_of_augStep` — old arcs, at most `d²`
transitive arcs and the chosen fraternal arcs — that is the whole budget
of a round.

# Independent of the ordering: fraternity densification

`fratGraph_lowDegreeVertex` is the load-bearing sparse-combinatorics
lemma of the Nešetřil–Ossona de Mendez argument, proved here
unconditionally: if an orientation of `H` has in-degree at most `d` and
every depth-1 minor of `H` on `m` vertices has at most `D₁ · m` edges,
then every nonempty set of vertices carries a vertex of fraternity degree
at most `d * d + d * D₁` inside it.  The proof is the private-witness
extraction: each fraternal pair inside `S` gets a witness `w`; the
witnesses lying inside `S` account for at most `d²` ordered pairs each,
and each witness `w` outside `S` is contracted into the one in-neighbour
of `w` that lies on the most pairs of `w`, which by averaging realizes at
least a `1/d` fraction of the pairs of `w` as edges of a depth-1 minor of
`H` on the vertex set `S`.  With `degeneracyLE_of_lowDegreeVertices` —
greedy elimination — that turns into an ordering, hence into an
orientation of the fraternity graph, which is what a greedy round needs.

# What the P6 program consumes

The program exhibits its own chain — its greedy degeneracy orientation of
`G` and, per round, its greedy orientation of the fraternity graph — and
instantiates

* `walk_of_arc`, the path invariant: every arc of round `i` is realized
  by a `G`-walk of length at most `2 ^ i`, the radius bookkeeping of the
  cover phase;
* `inDegLE_of_augStep`, the per-round budget `d + d² + k`;
* `exists_greedy_round` / `greedy_chain_inDegLE`, the greedy recursion.

The in-degree bound for the *computed* chain needs one input this file
does not prove: `AugmentedDepthOneDensity`, that the augmented graphs of
the rounds again have small depth-1 minor density.  It is carried as a
hypothesis of `greedy_chain_inDegLE`; every other statement here is
unconditional, and the existence theorem
`exists_augChain_subpolynomial` — the theorem the campaign's design
record names as the target — does not need it at all.

/-! ### The canonical chain

Fix an ordering `π`.  The canonical chain orients `G` by `π` and, at each
round, orients every newly demanded pair from its `π`-smaller to its
`π`-larger end.  That is a legal augmentation step exactly because the
arcs stay `π`-increasing: a transitive link `u → w → v` then has
`π u < π w < π v`, so the forward direction is the `π`-direction. -/

/-! ### Fraternity densification

The load-bearing sparse-combinatorics lemma, independent of any ordering:
a dense piece of the fraternity graph forces a dense depth-1 minor of the
oriented graph itself.  Each fraternal pair carries a private witness `w`
with `u → w ← v`; the pairs whose witness lies inside the set account for
at most `d²` each, and a witness outside the set is contracted into the
one of its in-neighbours that lies on the most of its pairs, which by
averaging realizes at least a `1/d` fraction of them as edges of a
depth-1 minor on the set. -/

/-- The realized pairs of a contraction form a depth-1 minor on `S`, so
there are at most `D₁ · |S|` of them.  `Used w` marks the witnesses that
were contracted, `a w` the vertex of `S` they were contracted into, and
`R` the pairs realized this way, listed once each. -/

**Fraternity densification.**  If an orientation of `H` has in-degree at
most `d` and every depth-1 minor of `H` on `m` vertices has at most
`D₁ · m` edges, then the fraternity graph of the orientation is
`(d² + d · D₁)`-degenerate in the elimination sense: every nonempty set of
vertices carries a vertex of fraternity degree at most `d² + d · D₁`
inside it.

# Proof

Suppose every vertex of `S` had more than `d² + d · D₁` fraternity
neighbours inside `S`, so that the ordered fraternal pairs inside `S`
number more than `|S| · (d² + d · D₁)`.  Give each pair a witness `w`,
symmetrically in the two ends.

Pairs whose witness lies in `S` are charged to that witness: both ends
are in-neighbours of it, so each `w ∈ S` carries at most `d²` of them,
and there are at most `|S| · d²` in total.

For a witness `w` outside `S`, all its pairs live inside
`A_w = N⁻(w) ∩ S`, of size at most `d`.  Contract `w` into the vertex
`a w ∈ A_w` lying on the most of them: by averaging over `A_w` that is at
least a `1/d` fraction.  The contracted pairs are the edges of a depth-1
minor of `H` on the vertex set `S` — the branch set of `x ∈ S` is `x`
together with the witnesses contracted into it, each an out-neighbour of
`x` — and distinct pairs are distinct edges of it because a pair has only
one witness.  So the density bound caps them at `D₁ · |S|`, and the pairs
with a witness outside `S` at `d · D₁ · |S|`.

Adding the two counts contradicts the assumed lower bound.

**Augmentation density theorem.**  For every nowhere dense class `C`,
every number of rounds `r` and every `δ > 0` there is a constant `c` such
that every subgraph `G` of a member, on `m` vertices, carries an
`r`-round tight transitive–fraternal augmentation chain in which

* every in-degree of every round is at most `c · m ^ δ`, and
* the fraternity graph of every round has back-degrees at most `c · m ^ δ`
  under a single vertex ranking `σ`.

The second clause is the "moreover" the greedy algorithm needs: together
with `inDegLE_of_augStep`, which charges a round at most `d + d² + k`
where `k` is the fraternal in-degree it chose, and `fratIn_le_of_backDegLE`,
which reads that in-degree off the ranking, it says that orienting the
fraternity graph along `σ` stays inside the budget.

/-! ### The greedy chain

The chain of `exists_augChain_subpolynomial` is one good chain, built from
a weak-coloring ordering.  The algorithm of Grohe–Kreutzer–Siebertz builds
its own, orienting each round's fraternity graph by a greedy elimination
ordering.  What one such round costs is `exists_greedy_round`, proved
unconditionally from the depth-1 density of the round's graph; what a
whole greedy chain costs is `greedy_chain_inDegLE`, which carries that
density as a hypothesis.

`AugmentedDepthOneDensity` is the one statement of this file that is not
proved: that the *augmented* graphs of a nowhere dense input again have
subpolynomial depth-1 minor density.  Its proof is the shallow-minor
transfer of Nešetřil–Ossona de Mendez — a depth-1 minor of an augmented
graph is a bounded-depth minor of the previous round's graph — which the
path invariant alone does not give, since the realizing walks of distinct
arcs are not disjoint. -/

/-- Every round's augmented graph has depth-1 minor density at most `D₁`.
This is the hypothesis the greedy chain bound is stated over. -/

/-- The round oriented its fraternal edges along a ranking that is as
good as the degeneracy of the fraternity graph allows: the specification
of a greedy elimination ordering.

The ranking is asked about the arcs the round *adds on fraternal
grounds alone* — an arc of `D'` that `D` did not carry and that no
transitive link forces — and about no others. That is the whole of what
`inDegLE_of_augStep` charges to the fraternity graph: an arc `D`
already had is charged to the old in-degree and a transitive one to the
`d²` transitive links, so asking the ranking about either would be
asking for more than the count needs. It would also be asking for more
than a round can deliver: a round inherits `D`'s arcs by `AugStep.mono`
and cannot re-orient them, and nothing makes an elimination ordering of
the fraternity graph agree with an arc that was already there. -/
