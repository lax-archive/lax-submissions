/-!
Depth-one density of the augmented graphs of a transitive–fraternal
augmentation chain.

# The obligation

`Lax3Proofs.Augmentation` proves everything about `r`-round augmentation
chains except one input of the in-degree bound for the chain the *program*
plays: `AugmentedDepthOneDensity`, the statement that the augmented graphs
of the rounds again have bounded depth-1 minor density.  It is what
`fratGraph_lowDegreeVertex` — the fraternity densification lemma, and with
it the whole greedy recursion — consumes at every round.  This file
discharges it on nowhere dense classes, for *arbitrary* chains with
per-round in-degree bounds, and re-runs the greedy recursion with no
density hypothesis left (`exists_greedy_chain_inDegLE`).

# Why the path invariant is not enough

Every arc of round `i` is realized by a `G`-walk of length at most `2 ^ i`
(`walk_of_arc`), so it is tempting to push a minor of the augmented graph
down along those walks.  That cannot work on its own: a star belongs to
every nowhere dense class and the square of a star is a clique, so
"realized by short walks" does not bound density at all.  Any proof has to
use the *orientation*: the in-degree bound is what makes the augmented
graph sparse, and it must enter the argument.  It does, in exactly one
place — `card_claims_le`.

The second obstruction is collision control.  Expanding an edge of the
augmented graph into its length-two realizing path introduces a witness
`w`, and witnesses of different edges collide, while the branch sets of a
minor model must be disjoint.  Expanding *all* the way down to `G` makes
this hopeless, since a vertex of `G` can lie on the realizing walks of
unboundedly many arcs.

# The route

One round at a time, in the graphs of the rounds themselves, never in `G`.

Every edge of the augmented graph `D'.toGraph` is either an edge of the
round's own graph `H` or has a witness `w` adjacent in `H` to both ends,
*one of which is an in-neighbour of `w`* (`edge_realization`).  So a branch
set may only ever claim a witness through a vertex of its own that is an
in-neighbour of it — and since in-degrees are at most `d` and branch sets
are disjoint, at most `d + 1` branch sets can claim any given vertex
(`card_claims_le`).

An *awarding* is a map `ω : Fin n → Fin m` giving every vertex of `H` to at
most one branch set; the awarded branch set of `ξ` is `ball H ω b (c ξ) ξ`,
everything reachable from the old centre inside the class `ω⁻¹ ξ`.
Disjointness and the radius bound of the resulting model are then free —
that is the point of the definition — and all the work moves into showing
that many edges survive.  An edge survives if `ω` obeys a demand:
finitely many vertices awarded a specified way.  The demand is built by
expanding the two centre-to-endpoint walks of the given model into `H`
(`exists_expand`) and then reading a *first crossing* off the
concatenation (`exists_first_entry`); crossing first is what makes the two
halves of the demand disjoint, so the demand really is a partial function
and not an unsatisfiable pair of constraints.  A demand names at most
`6a+6` vertices, each with at most `d+2` possible owners, so averaging
over all awardings (`exists_awarding`, a product-measure count on
`Fintype.piFinset`) produces one awarding that keeps a
`1 / (d+2) ^ (6a+6)` fraction of the edges.  That is `roundTransfer`: a
depth-`a` minor of the augmented graph becomes a depth-`(4a+4)` minor of
`H` on no more vertices, with a `stepFactor d a` loss in density.

Iterating `r` times (`chain_density`) bounds the depth-1 density of round
`i` by the depth-`chainDepth i 1` density of `G`, which on a nowhere dense
class is subpolynomial by `Lax199508`'s density theorem
(`exists_densityAtMost_of_nowhereDense`).  No walk in `G` is ever
expanded, and no shallow-minor composition is needed: the induction stays
inside one round at a time.

# The joint recursion

The in-degree bound of round `i+1` needs the depth-1 density of round `i`,
and that density needs the in-degree bounds of the rounds *before* `i` —
never of round `i` itself.  So the two recursions close as one: `joint`
computes the pair (in-degree budget, depth-parametric density budget) and
`greedy_chain_joint` is the single induction that proves both halves,
`fratGraph_lowDegreeVertex` and `inDegLE_of_augStep` supplying the
in-degree step and `roundTransfer` the density step.

# What the program phase supplies

Its own chain (`IsAugChain G D r`), the fact that each round orients its
fraternity graph greedily (`GreedyFratRound`), and a starting in-degree
`d` for `D 0`; `exists_greedy_chain_inDegLE` then bounds every round's
in-degree by `(joint d ⌈c · m ^ δ⌉ i).1`.  A chain with in-degree bounds
from any other source instead instantiates `exists_chain_density`, whose
budget `chainDens dd D₁ i 1` is `chainConst dd i 1 * D₁` by
`chainDens_eq`: a polynomial in the earlier rounds' in-degrees times the
subpolynomial density of `G`.

One round of the process turns a depth-`a` minor of the augmented graph
into a depth-`stepDepth a` minor of the round's own graph, at the price
of a factor `stepFactor d a` in the density.  `RoundTransfer` names that
statement; it is proved as `roundTransfer` below and is stated separately
only so that the chain bookkeeping can be read off from it. -/

/-! ### Awarding witnesses to branch sets

The proof of the transfer.  A depth-`a` minor model of `J` in the
augmented graph is turned into a model in `H` by *awarding* every vertex
of `H` to at most one branch set: an awarding is a map
`ω : Fin n → Fin m`, and the branch set of `ξ` becomes the set of
vertices reachable from the old center inside the class `ω⁻¹ ξ`.
Disjointness and the radius bound are then free, and all the work is in
showing that a `1 / (d+2) ^ (8a+8)` fraction of the edges of `J` survives
for some awarding. -/

/-! ### The chain bookkeeping

Iterating the transfer `i` times bounds the depth-`a` density of the
`i`-th round's graph by the depth-`chainDepth i a` density of `G`, times
`chainDens`, a product of one factor per earlier round.  Only the
in-degree bounds of the rounds *before* `i` enter — which is what lets
the density recursion and the in-degree recursion of a greedy chain be
run as one joint induction. -/

/-! ### The joint recursion of a greedy chain

The in-degree bound of round `i + 1` needs the depth-1 density of round
`i`, and that density needs the in-degree bounds of the rounds before
`i`.  The two recursions therefore close as one: `joint` computes the
pair, and `greedy_chain_joint` is the single induction that establishes
both halves. -/

/-- The joint recursion: `(joint d D₁ i).1` is the in-degree budget of
round `i` of a greedy chain started at in-degree `d`, and
`(joint d D₁ i).2 a` the depth-`a` density budget of round `i`'s graph,
given the depth-`chainDepth i a` density `D₁` of `G`. -/
