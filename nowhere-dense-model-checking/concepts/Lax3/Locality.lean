title: Locality theorem for distance logic
type: theorem
---
Every formula of distance logic of distance rank (*k*, *q*) is
equivalent to a boolean combination of *local* formulas and scatter
sentences, all of distance rank (*k*, *q*). This is the locality
theorem of the source note (arXiv:2606.23180, Theorem 1), in the spirit
of Gaifman's locality theorem and of the locality theorem of Grohe,
Kreutzer and Siebertz: unrestricted quantification is eliminated in
favour of quantification inside a bounded neighborhood of the free
variables, plus finitely many global assertions of the form "there are
*t* pairwise far apart vertices satisfying β". What distinguishes this
version, and what makes it usable, is that the rewriting does not
increase the rank — and the rank it preserves, distance rank, controls
the radii of everything the resulting formulas mention.

The theorem holds for every scatter choice; which one is fixed is
invisible to the statement and decisive for the algorithm, which
evaluates scatter sentences by running the greedy process. The
companion statement `Lax3.NormalForm` — the analogue of Gaifman's
normal form — instantiates the maximum-size choice and writes the
scatter sentences out in the logic itself.

# Formalization notes

The boolean combination is reified: `BC α` is the type of boolean
combinations of atoms drawn from `α`, with an evaluation map and a list
of the atoms occurring in it. That list is what carries the side
conditions of the theorem — "all of distance rank (*k*, *q*)" is a
statement about the atoms of the combination, and a bare `Prop`-level
equivalence could not express it. Atoms are the sum type of formulas
and scatter sentences, so one boolean combination mixes the two kinds
and `Sum.elim` supplies their two evaluations.

Effectiveness is deliberately absent. The source says the boolean
combination "can be effectively computed"; the statement here asserts
only that it exists. Nothing is lost: the rewriting is discharged by an
explicit Lean function on syntax with a soundness lemma, and it is that
function — not the existential — that the model-checking algorithm of
this submission consumes, together with the fact that a Lean function
on an inductive syntax is by construction an algorithm. Stating
effectiveness in the existential form ("there is a computable map …")
would add a machine model to a statement about logic, and the machine
model this submission uses is the word RAM of submission Lax67, which
enters at the headline theorem and not before.

The statement is an `axiom` on this concept surface and is proved in
the proofs package of this submission. It is also the interface a
future merge-width submission consumes, which is why the rewriting
function is proofs-side and the existential is here: a consumer that
needs the function can require the proofs package, and a consumer that
needs only the equivalence takes the statement.

/-- **Locality theorem** (Theorem 1 of arXiv:2606.23180). Fix a scatter
choice. Every formula of distance rank `(k, q)` is equivalent to a
boolean combination of local formulas of distance rank `(k, q)` and
scatter sentences of distance rank `(k, q)`: there is a boolean
combination whose formula atoms are all local of distance rank `(k, q)`,
whose scatter-sentence atoms all have distance rank `(k, q)`, and which
has the same truth value as the formula in every finite colored graph
under every environment. -/
