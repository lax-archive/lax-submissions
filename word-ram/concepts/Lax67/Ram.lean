title: The word RAM
type: definition
---
A word RAM is a random access machine whose writable memory consists of
`2 ^ w` cells holding natural numbers below `2 ^ w`. The word length
`w` is a parameter; one finite program serves all word lengths. Input
is a read-only finite array supplied at initialization, also accessible
as a sequential tape. Output is an append-only tape. Working memory
starts at zero and output starts empty.

The input interface has four operations. `read a` consumes the next
entry of the sequential tape into cell `a`, halting if the tape is
empty. `jeof l` branches on tape emptiness without consuming input.
`inputLength a` writes the original input length into cell `a`.
`inputLoad a b` reads the original input at the index in cell `b` into
cell `a`, returning zero outside the input. Indexed access never
consumes the sequential tape, and sequential reads never change the
original input. Zero is ordinary data, not an end marker. Each operation
costs one instruction. No length header or other framing is added to
the supplied list.

Arithmetic results, input values and lengths, output values, and
data-memory addresses are reduced modulo `2 ^ w`. Subtraction is
truncated at zero, and division is integer division with `x / 0 = 0`.
Input indices are words too. Program labels and the program counter are
natural numbers and are not reduced modulo `2 ^ w`.

# Formalization notes

The register-transfer format follows Cook and Reckhow (*Time bounded
random access machines*, JCSS 7, 1973): instructions act on numbered
cells, with indirection through a cell holding an address. Their cells
hold signed integers, and their sequential input has a distinguished
zero end marker outside its input alphabet. This definition instead
uses unsigned words, supplies explicit EOF detection, and additionally
provides indexed read-only input with its length available in constant
time. It therefore specifies its own input convention; the interface
is not an identification with the original Cook--Reckhow input tape.

Word operations have unit cost, as in the bounded-word models of
Fredman and Willard (*Surpassing the information theoretic bound with
fusion trees*, JCSS 47, 1993) and Hagerup (*Sorting and searching on the
word RAM*, STACS 1998). Comparisons with other word-RAM presentations
must fix the available operations, input convention, and address-space
assumptions. Indexed input avoids a compulsory input scan, as in an
input-array RAM. A simulation that instead starts from sequential input
and loads an `n`-word array pays an additive `O(n)` cost, giving
`O(n + T)`, which is `O(T)` only under a suitable lower bound on `T`.
No unconditional constant-factor model-equivalence claim is made here.

`setCell` reduces each value stored and each destination address modulo
`2 ^ w`. Other data-memory operands and indirect addresses are reduced
at use; output and input values are reduced too. From initialization,
every reachable memory cell holds a word. The function representation
of memory has domain `ℕ`, but execution accesses only the residues below
`2 ^ w`. Program control is separate: `jump`, `jzero`, and `jeof` use
untruncated program labels, ordinary advancement increments the full
program counter, and instruction fetch uses that counter.

Oversized input entries and the length are reduced rather than
rejected. To recover an entry unchanged requires that entry to be below
`2 ^ w`; to recover the complete original length with `inputLength`
requires `x.length < 2 ^ w`. These fitting conditions belong in the
admissible domain of the theorem that needs them. EOF-based programs
can process lists whose total length does not fit in a word. Indexed
reads can address the prefix with indices below `2 ^ w`; the initial
array itself is read-only input storage, separate from writable memory.

Subtraction is natural-number monus, so a comparison is `sub` followed
by `jzero`. Complement is `2 ^ w - 1 - m[b]`. No instruction returns
the word length. The following operations are derived at constant cost,
with scratch cells `t` and `u` whose physical addresses modulo `2 ^ w`
are distinct from each other and from every operand's physical address.
Distinct natural-number literals alone do not ensure this condition:

| operation | instructions | count |
|---|---|---|
| copy `a ← b` | `set t b; load a t` | 2 |
| `a ← b ∨ c` | `and t b c; sub t c t; add a b t` | 3 |
| `a ← b ⊕ c` | `and t b c; sub u c t; add u b u; sub a u t` | 4 |
| `a ← b ≫ c` | `set t 1; shiftl t t c; div a b t` | 3 |
| `a ← b mod c` | `div t b c; mul t t c; sub a b t` | 3 |
| if `b ≤ c` goto `l` | `sub t b c; jzero t l` | 2 |
| if `b < c` goto `l` | `sub t c b; jzero t l'; jump l; l':` | 3 |
| if `b = c` goto `l` | `sub t b c; sub u c b; add t t u; jzero t l` | 4 |

An explicit `halt`, an exhausted `read`, or an out-of-range program
counter terminates execution. `step` returns `none` in all three cases.
`run w p k` counts successful transitions only. `RunsTo` adds the cost
of the fetched terminal instruction: one for `halt` or exhausted `read`,
and zero for an out-of-range counter, where no instruction exists.
Thus `RunsTo` counts every executed instruction exactly once, and an
empty program costs zero. Termination constrains the entire output
tape; memory is left unconstrained.

The separate read-only input preserves a fixed working-memory layout.
An input-in-memory convention could also reserve fixed low-address
working cells and put input at a fixed base; no length-dependent input
base is necessary. Copying this model's input into writable memory,
when desired and when the chosen layout fits, takes constant overhead
per word and linear total time: a uniform loader uses `read` into a
temporary cell, an indirect `store`, and loop maintenance.

There is no separate space measure or randomness primitive. A space
measure can be defined over executions; writable memory has `2 ^ w`
cells. A deterministic program can consume additional input words to
model supplied random choices.
