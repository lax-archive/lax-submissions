The phase driver: a priority-ordered pipeline of passes over one
translation state.

Port of `thys/Automatic_Refinement/Tool/Autoref_Phases.thy` of AFP
`Automatic_Refinement` (Lammich) at the pin recorded in
`plans/word-ram/refinement-tower/design.md` §1 — AFP for Isabelle2025-2,
release 2026-02-06. The verbatim source text this file is checked
against is `plans/word-ram/refinement-tower/p2-tool-extracts.md` §6.
Design record §3, P2 row 4:

> Autoref phases: id-ops, fix-rel, translate (`Autoref_Phases`,
> `Autoref_Id_Ops`, `Autoref_Fix_Rel`, `Autoref_Translate`,
> `Autoref_Tagging`) → `Autoref/Tool.lean` (phases under source names):
> locales carrying phase state → structures threaded through a `MetaM`
> pipeline.

This file is the *structure threaded through the pipeline* and the
driver that threads it. The four phases themselves are in
`Autoref/IdOps.lean` (`id_op`, `rel_inf`), `Autoref/FixRel.lean`
(`fix_rel`) and `Autoref/Translate.lean` (`trans`), which is the
source's own file split; `Autoref/Tool.lean` registers them in the
source's priority order.

## The source, verbatim

`Autoref_Phases.thy` has no lemmas and no `attribute_setup` /
`method_setup` — it is entirely ML infrastructure. Its citable form is
the module signature, which documents the record every phase must
implement:

```ml
signature AUTOREF_PHASES = sig
  type phase = {
    init: Proof.context -> Proof.context,
    tac: Proof.context -> int -> int -> tactic,
    analyze: Proof.context -> int -> int -> thm -> bool,
    pretty_failure: Proof.context -> int -> int -> thm -> Pretty.T
  }

  val register_phase: string -> int -> phase ->
    morphism -> Context.generic -> Context.generic
  val delete_phase: string -> morphism -> Context.generic -> Context.generic
  val get_phases: Proof.context -> (string * int * phase) list

  val get_phase: string -> Proof.context -> (string * int * phase) option

  val init_phase: (string * int * phase) -> Proof.context -> Proof.context
  val init_phases:
    (string * int * phase) list -> Proof.context -> Proof.context

  val init_data: Proof.context -> Proof.context

  val declare_solver: thm list -> binding -> string
    -> (Proof.context -> tactic') -> morphism
    -> Context.generic -> Context.generic

  val phase_tac: (string * int * phase) -> Proof.context -> tactic'
  val phases_tac: (string * int * phase) list -> Proof.context -> tactic'
  val all_phases_tac: Proof.context -> tactic'

  val phases_tacN: string list -> Proof.context -> tactic'
  val phase_tacN: string -> Proof.context -> tactic'

  val cfg_debug: bool Config.T
  val cfg_trace: bool Config.T
  val cfg_keep_goal: bool Config.T
end
```

and the structural description the extract gives of the driver:

> phases are kept in a priority-sorted `Generic_Data` list (`phase_data`,
> `register_phase`/`delete_phase`/`get_phases`); `do_phase` runs one
> phase's `tac` under `DETERM`, times it if `cfg_trace`, then branches on
> `analyze` into either the continuation (`THEN_INTERVAL`, chaining to
> the next phase) or `handle_fail_tac`, which prints `pretty_failure`'s
> output under `cfg_debug` and then either fails the tactic (default)
> or, if `cfg_keep_goal` is set, returns the goal state unchanged.

## Substrate deltas and departures, each flagged

**P0 — the wave is six modules where design record §7 lists one.** §7's
P2 skeleton is `Autoref/{Relators,Param,Solver,Tool}`; wave B2 already
split `Tagging.lean` out of it (its delta T1) for the reason the source
itself splits `Autoref_Tagging.thy` out. This wave splits the rest the
same way and for the same reason: `Autoref/{Phases,IdOps,FixRel,
Translate,Tool,BindingsHOL}.lean` stand one-for-one against
`Tool/Autoref_{Phases,Id_Ops,Fix_Rel,Translate,Tool}.thy` and
`Autoref_Bindings_HOL.thy`, so that a reader checking this port against
the extract checks one file against one theory, and so that each
phase's *constants*, its *calculus* and its *implementation* live
together — which is how the source arranges them and what the fidelity
charter's "the sources' design wins by default" means here. Folding all
five into `Tool.lean` would have produced one 2000-line module whose
correspondence to the extract had to be reconstructed by eye. Recorded
as a departure from §7's file list, not from the source.
(`Autoref_Gen_Algo.thy` is the one theory that does *not* get its own
module — `Autoref/Tool.lean` delta O5 says why.)

**P1 — the phase record carries an explicit state, not a
`Proof.context`.** The source's four phases communicate through the
proof context (each phase's `init` installs its rule nets there) and
through the goal state (each phase rewrites the goal its successor
reads). Design record §3 prescribes the Lean rendering — "locales
carrying phase state → structures threaded through a `MetaM` pipeline" —
and `State` below is that structure. It carries the *goal* (so the
source's goal-state channel survives verbatim: `id_op` and `rel_inf`
really do rewrite `(?c, a) ∈ ?R` into `(?c, a') ∈ ?R`, exactly as the
source's `ID_init` / `ROI_init` resolutions do) plus the three pieces of
data that have nowhere else to live: the interface `id_op` assigned, the
extra rules the call site supplied, and the configuration.

**P1a — the pipeline monad is `TermElabM`, not `MetaM`.** Design record
§3 says "a `MetaM` pipeline", and every phase body below is a `MetaM`
computation; the signature is one level up because the `trans` phase
discharges side conditions through wave B2's `tagged_solver`, which is a
`TacticM` tactic, and `Lean.Elab.Tactic.run` — the only way to run a
tactic on a metavariable — lands in `TermElabM`. Nothing else in the
pipeline uses the extra capability.

**P2 — `tac`'s goal interval becomes the single `goal` field.** The
source's `tac : Proof.context -> int -> int -> tactic` operates on a
*range* `i..j` of subgoals, because an Isabelle tactic may split one
goal into many and the phase driver must know which ones are its own.
A `MetaM` pass returning a new `State` needs no interval: a phase that
manufactures subgoals discharges them itself (`fix_rel`, `trans`) or
threads the one it produced (`id_op`, `rel_inf`).

**P3 — `analyze` returns the failure message it found, and
`pretty_failure` renders it.** The source splits the two because an
Isabelle tactic cannot carry a message: `analyze` returns `bool` and the
driver calls `pretty_failure` on the goal state afterwards. Here
`analyze` returns `Option MessageData` — `none` for the source's `true`
— and `prettyFailure` is still a separate hook, because it is also
applied to *exceptions* thrown from inside `run`, which is where the
phases actually report (a Lean exception carries its message, so the
common case needs no `analyze` at all). Both hooks are kept so that a
phase can report either way, as the source's do.

**P4 — the registry is an `IO.Ref`, not an environment extension.** A
`Phase` holds `MetaM` closures, which no environment extension can
serialise; the source's `Generic_Data` holds ML closures for the same
reason and is likewise not part of any persistent theory content. The
registration therefore happens in `initialize` blocks (`Autoref/Tool.lean`),
which Lean runs once per process at import time — the same "runs when
the theory is loaded" semantics the source's `declaration` blocks have.
`register_phase` / `delete_phase` / `get_phases` / `get_phase` are ported
one for one; `init_phases` is `Phase.init` run by the driver;
`init_data` has no counterpart, because there is no lazily-initialised
context data to guard (delta P1 removed the channel it guarded).

**P5 — `declare_solver` is `Autoref/Solver.lean`'s `declare_solver`.**
The source wraps `Tagged_Solver.declare_solver` here only to force
`init_data`; with no context data to initialise (P4), the wrapper has no
content, and wave B2's command is used directly.

**P6 — the failure format is uniform, and that is the point.** The
extract records that the source has "no single shared error format" —
each phase renders its own leftovers. The plan's supervision-legibility
watch item asks for the opposite: *every* pipeline failure must name its
phase and its unmet side condition. So `runPhase` wraps whatever the
phase reports in one envelope naming the phase and its priority, and the
phases fill the envelope with the offending subterm. This is an
addition, not a loss: each phase's own message is still its own.
