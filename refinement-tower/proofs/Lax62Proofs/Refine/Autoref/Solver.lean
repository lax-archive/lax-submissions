The side-condition solver registry: solvers keyed by tag, dispatched by
priority.

Port of `thys/Automatic_Refinement/Lib/Tagged_Solver.thy` (and, through
it, `Lib/Prio_List.thy`) of AFP `Automatic_Refinement` (Lammich) at the
pin recorded in `plans/word-ram/refinement-tower/design.md` §1 — AFP for
Isabelle2025-2, release 2026-02-06. Design record §3, P2 row 3:

> tagged solvers, priority lists (`Tagged_Solver`, `Prio_List`,
> `Attr_Comb`) → `Autoref/Solver.lean`: side-condition solver registry.
> ML functor gymnastics → ordinary Lean 4 extension points; DiscrTree
> replaces `Anti_Unification`-based indexing (a strict improvement the
> charter's rule 3 permits: infrastructure, not calculus).

## The source

`Tagged_Solver.thy` is pure ML — there is no Isar surface to quote
beyond one `method_setup` line, so the citable form of the source is its
ML *signature*, which is the interface the port is measured against:

```ml
signature TAGGED_SOLVER = sig
  type solver = thm list * string * string * (Proof.context -> tactic')

  val get_solvers: Proof.context -> solver list
  val declare_solver: thm list -> binding -> string
    -> (Proof.context -> tactic') -> morphism
    -> Context.generic -> Context.generic

  val lookup_solver: string -> Context.generic -> solver option
  val add_triggers: string -> thm list -> morphism ->
    Context.generic -> Context.generic

  val delete_solver: string -> morphism -> Context.generic -> Context.generic

  val tac_of_solver: Proof.context -> solver -> tactic'

  val get_potential_solvers: Proof.context -> int -> thm -> solver list
  val get_potential_tacs: Proof.context -> int -> thm -> tactic' list

  val solve_greedy_step_tac: Proof.context -> tactic'
  val solve_greedy_tac: Proof.context -> tactic'
  val solve_greedy_keep_tac: Proof.context -> tactic'

  val solve_full_step_tac: Proof.context -> tactic'
  val solve_full_tac: Proof.context -> tactic'
  val solve_full_keep_tac: Proof.context -> tactic'

  val cfg_keep: bool Config.T
  val cfg_trace: bool Config.T
  val cfg_full: bool Config.T
  val cfg_step: bool Config.T

  val solve_tac: Proof.context -> tactic'

  val pretty_solvers: Proof.context -> Pretty.T
end

method_setup tagged_solver =
  "Select tactic to solve goal by pattern"
```

and `Prio_List.thy`, the ordering structure `Tagged_Solver` stores its
solvers in — "a list of items with insertion operation relative to other
items (after, before) and relative to absolute positions (first, last)":

```ml
signature PRIO_LIST = sig
  type T
  type item

  val empty: T
  val add_first: T -> item -> T
  val add_last: T -> item -> T
  val add_before: T -> item -> item -> T
  val add_after: T -> item -> item -> T

  val delete: item -> T -> T

  val prio_of: (item -> bool) -> (item * item -> bool) -> T -> int
  val contains: T -> item -> bool

  val dest: T -> item list

  val merge: T * T -> T
  val merge': T * T -> item list * T
end
```

(Both fetched 2026-07-29 from the mirror the P2 extract files use,
`isabelle-prover/mirror-afp-devel` at `master` — the same mirror and the
same justification as `p2-autoref-extracts.md`'s header. Neither file
is covered by an extract in `plans/`, because both are ML: the extract
convention of this campaign is to quote Isar, and there is none here
beyond the `method_setup` binder line above. The two signature blocks
are therefore reproduced in this header, and *this header is the
citable form of the source* for anything downstream wants to check.)

`solver` reads: **trigger theorems**, **name**, **description**,
**tactic**. That four-field shape, the priority ordering, and the
`potential solvers → try them → report` dispatch are what this file
ports.

## Role

A "side condition" is a goal the translation pipeline manufactures
rather than one the user wrote: `SIDE_PRECOND (l ≠ [])` from
`autoref_hd`, single-valuedness of a relator, a `GEN_OP` instance, a
deferred constraint. Each family has its own decision procedure, and no
single tactic should know about all of them. `Tagged_Solver` is the
indirection: a *tag* constant marks the family, each decision procedure
registers itself against a tag, and the pipeline discharges everything
it manufactures with one call to `tagged_solver`. Wave C's rule files
register into it; nothing registers here except this file's own demo.

## What this seed does *not* do

Stated against the signature above, in the P1 style (the `refine_vcg`
header's "this is the *seed* of the abstract VCG, and its maturity is
stated honestly"):

**S1 — triggers are head constants, not trigger theorems.** The
source's first `solver` component is a `thm list` matched against the
goal by `Anti_Unification`; here it is one `Name`, the head constant of
the goal. Source triggers that discriminate below the head — two
`SIDE_PRECOND` solvers keyed on the *shape* of the precondition, say —
collapse onto the same tag here. The consequences are contained and
worth naming: a solver must fail cleanly on a goal it does not handle,
and `tagged_solver_full` (which walks the whole candidate list) exists
precisely so that a coarse trigger stays recoverable. Refining `trigger`
to a pattern is a change behind `TaggedSolver.potential` and nothing
else.

**S2 — the registry is a linear scan, not a DiscrTree.** Design record
P2 row 3 promises DiscrTree in place of `Anti_Unification` indexing;
what is implemented is a filter over the registry array. At spine scope
(a handful of solvers, called once per manufactured side condition) the
difference is unmeasurable, and pretending otherwise would be the
dishonest option. The DiscrTree upgrade is, again, local to
`TaggedSolver.potential`.

**S3 — priority is a `Nat`, not a `Prio_List`.** The source orders
solvers by *relative* insertion (`add_first` / `add_last` /
`add_before` / `add_after`), reads a position back with `prio_of`, and
merges two orders when contexts merge. A numeric key was chosen instead
because a Lean persistent environment extension is a flat array whose
entries arrive in import order: relative insertion would have to be
replayed at import time and would not be confluent across independent
imports, whereas a `Nat` sorts deterministically however the modules are
arranged. Higher wins; ties break on the solver name, so the order is
total and reproducible. `delete_solver`, `add_triggers` and `merge` have
no counterpart.

**S4 — the tactic payload is stored syntax, not an ML closure.** The
source stores `Proof.context -> tactic'`, a closure over its declaration
context. We store the `Syntax` of the tactic together with the
namespace and `open` declarations in force where it was declared, and
re-elaborate it at dispatch time inside that name-resolution context —
so a solver written in one module resolves its own constants when run
from another (the demo below exercises exactly this). What is *not*
captured is term-level context: a solver tactic must not depend on
section `variable`s or local hypotheses of its declaration site.

**S5 — no goal addressing, no config flags.** `tactic'` in the source is
`int -> tactic`, and `get_potential_solvers` takes a goal index; here
every entry point acts on the main goal. The four `Config.T` flags
become tactic *names* — `tagged_solver` (greedy), `tagged_solver_full`
(backtracking, `cfg_full`), `tagged_solver_step` (one step, goals kept,
`cfg_step` + `cfg_keep`), `tagged_solver_trace` (`cfg_trace`) — because
Lean's `set_option` plumbing buys nothing at four flags.
`solve_full_keep_tac` has no counterpart. `pretty_solvers` is
`TaggedSolver.explain`.

**S6 — greedy is one step, not a loop.** The source's
`solve_greedy_tac` iterates `solve_greedy_step_tac` to exhaustion.
`tagged_solver` here dispatches once and requires the chosen solver to
close the goal, which is what a side-condition solver does; a solver
that wants to recurse calls `tagged_solver` again from inside its own
tactic. Recorded rather than worked around: the iteration is
three lines whenever a consumer needs it, and a bounded loop with no
consumer is a maintenance liability.

**S7 — the record and its extension live one module upstream.**
`structure TaggedSolver` (the port of the source's `type solver`, field
for field) and the persistent environment extension holding the registry
are declared in `Autoref/Attrs.lean`, not here. This is P1's delta B7
again, in its sharper form: an `initialize` value is unavailable to its
own module, so a `declare_solver` *in this file* — which the gate below
needs — dies with `cannot evaluate [init] declaration … in the same
module`. `Attrs.lean` is the module that exists for this constraint, and
the split costs nothing: everything that reasons about the record is
here, and the field comments there point at the deltas above.

The dispatch failure messages carry the plan's supervision-legibility
requirement: every failure names the tag it dispatched on and every
solver it considered, with priorities. The message text is built by the
`TaggedSolver.*Msg` functions below, and the gate at the bottom of this
file checks those functions' output verbatim.

everywhere downstream, and this module is on the archive root's import

unusable as identifiers archive-wide (it broke this file's own
`let prio := …` first). `for`, `at` and `with` are already Lean
keywords, so reusing them reserves nothing new. -/

/-! ### The executable gate (design record ledger D4)

Two demo solvers at different priorities on one demo tag, plus a tag
with no solver at all. Everything the plan asks the gate to show —
dispatch, priority order, and a failure message that names the tag — is
checked here, and every check is either a `#guard_msgs` on the
dispatcher's own message functions or an `example` that must elaborate.
Nothing in this section leaves an error or a `sorry` behind: the two
failure demonstrations use `fail_if_success` and `tagged_solver_trace`.

The demo tag and the demo solvers live in a nested namespace and the
`example`s do not; that is on purpose, and it is the check for delta
S4's name-resolution capture: `demo_low`'s tactic says
`unfold DemoGoal`, an unqualified name that only resolves inside
`Demo`, and it is dispatched from outside it. -/
