The tag layer: term protection, annotation, and interface types.

Port of `thys/Automatic_Refinement/Tool/Autoref_Tagging.thy` and the
interface-type head of `thys/Automatic_Refinement/Tool/Autoref_Id_Ops.thy`
of AFP `Automatic_Refinement` (Lammich) at the pin recorded in
`plans/word-ram/refinement-tower/design.md` §1 — AFP for Isabelle2025-2,
release 2026-02-06. The verbatim source text this file is checked
against is `plans/word-ram/refinement-tower/p2-autoref-extracts.md` §3;
everything below quotes it in its doc-comments.

Nothing here mentions `NRest` or any relator: the tag layer is pure
term plumbing, one layer below both, and the import list is
`Autoref/Attrs.lean` and nothing else.

## What this layer is for (the extract's closing "Role" paragraph)

> `APP`/`OP`/`ANNOT`/`PROTECT`/`ABS` exist purely so Autoref's (and,
> downstream, Sepref's) term-rewriting passes have a syntax-directed
> handle on application, abstraction, and "stop looking here" boundaries
> that survives Isabelle's automatic beta/eta contraction and
> higher-order unification — every rewrite rule in the pipeline is
> stated over tagged terms, never raw HOL applications. `CONST_INTF`/
> `ID_OP` sit one layer up: they carry the *conceptual type* (interface)
> assigned to a tagged term through the identification phase, so that by
> the time Autoref reaches relator inference, every subterm's abstract
> interface is already fixed data, not something to re-derive.

and, on why the device is not weakened by the move to Lean:

> Design.md's Lean counterpart (`Autoref/Tool.lean`, phases under source
> names, design.md P2 row 4) needs an analogous protection device only
> insofar as Lean's own HOU is weaker than Isabelle's, not stronger
> (design.md §2, substrate delta 3) — the `hn_ctxt`-style tagging
> discipline is *more* load-bearing under Lean, per design.md fidelity
> note under P4.

## Substrate deltas and departures, each flagged

**T1 — `Tagging.lean` is a module the design record does not list.**
Design record §7's P2 skeleton is `Autoref/{Relators,Param,Solver,Tool}`.
The tag layer is split out into a fifth module rather than folded into
`Tool.lean` for one reason: `Tool.lean` is the *phase driver*
(`Autoref_Phases`/`Autoref_Translate`), the tags are *object-language
constants* that every rule in wave C is stated over, and wave C's rule
files must import the constants without importing the driver. Keeping
`Tool.lean` free for the driver is the whole point; the source itself
splits the same way (`Autoref_Tagging.thy` is its own theory, imported
by `Autoref_Id_Ops.thy`, imported by `Autoref_Tool.thy`). Recorded here
as a departure from §7's file list, not from the source.

**T2 — `typedecl` and `consts` are rendered without axioms.** Isabelle's
`typedecl annot` / `typedecl rel_name` / `typedecl interface` introduce
opaque nonempty types, and `consts rel_annot` / `ind_annot` / `i_fun`
introduce uninterpreted constants — both are axiomatic devices. Adding
axioms is not available to us (the archive's headline claims are
kernel-clean and stay that way), so each is rendered as a small
inductive:

* `RelName` is a `String`-carrying structure. The source's inhabitants
  of `rel_name` arise from users writing `consts my_name :: rel_name`;
  `RelName.mk "my_name"` is that, with decidable equality thrown in.
* `Interface` is the free term algebra `const (name : String) | app`,
  which is exactly what the source's interface terms *are*: user-declared
  constants (`i_std`, `i_nat`, `consts i_graph :: interface ⇒ interface`)
  applied to each other through `intfAPP`. `i_fun` becomes the
  constructor application `app (app (const "i_fun") i₁) i₂`, so
  `i₁ →ᵢ i₂` is an injective marker — which is what every phase treats
  it as, and what the source can only assume.
* `Annot` is `rel | ind (s : RelName)`. Here one bit of information is
  dropped on purpose: `rel_annot`'s argument `R : Set (γ × α)` cannot be
  stored in a `Type`-valued `Annot` without lifting `Annot` to `Type 1`,
  and lifting it would put a `Type 1` argument on `ANNOT`, which every
  tagged term in the pipeline carries. It is not needed: `rel_annot R`
  is an *application term*, so `R` is present in the syntax tree that
  the phases match on, exactly as it is in the source, where
  `rel_annot` likewise has no defining equation. The price is that
  `rel_annot R = rel_annot R'` is provable here and merely unprovable
  there; nothing in the pipeline asks.

  For the same reason `rel_annot` and `ind_annot` are the two
  definitions in this file that get **no** `[simp]` tag and no
  `autoref_tag_defs` entry: the source's `consts` cannot be unfolded at
  all, and a simp set that erased the annotation would erase the point.

**T3 — notation spellings.** Three of the source's infixes are taken
verbatim (`:::` at 10, `::#` at 10, both Lean-legal tokens); three are
not Lean-legal and are respelled at the source's own precedence and
associativity:

| source | here | why |
|---|---|---|
| `f$a`, `infixl 900` | `f $ᵃ a`, `infixl:900` | `$` is Lean 4's antiquotation marker. `ᵃ` for *autoref application*; the `ᵣ` subscript is already spoken for by `Relators.lean`'s `→ᵣ` / `×ᵣ` |
| `i1→⇩ii2`, `infixr 60` | `i₁ →ᵢ i₂`, `infixr:60` | subscript-i rendered as `ᵢ` |
| `c::⇩i I`, `infixr 10` | `c ::ᵢ I`, `infixr:10` | same |

The source's `binder "λ''"` for `ABS` is **not** ported. It would add a
`term`-level syntax beginning with `λ` to a module the archive root
imports, and the blast radius of a tokenizer interaction with Lean's own
`λ` is out of proportion to a display convenience: `ABS f` is the
artifact, and it is written `ABS fun x => …`. Revisit if a wave-C rule
statement turns out to be unreadable without it.

**T4 — `Sort u`, not `Type`.** HOL has one universe of types and `bool`
lives in it, so `PROTECT`/`OP`/`APP`/`ANNOT`/`CONST_INTF`/`ID_OP` are
applied to propositions as freely as to data. In Lean that is the
`Prop`/`Type` split, so the tag constants are universe-polymorphic over
`Sort`. This is the direction of *more* generality, and it is the only
rendering under which the tags can protect a `Prop`-valued side
condition — which is precisely what wave C's `SIDE_PRECOND`-shaped rules
will need. `rel_annot`/`rel_ANNOT` are the exception: their relation
argument forces `Type` on the annotated type, as in `Relators.lean`.

**T5 — what is deliberately absent.** `GEN_OP`, `SIDE_PRECOND`, the
`PRIO_TAG_*` family and everything else from `Autoref_Fix_Rel.thy` is
**not** defined here, in any form. No verbatim extract of that theory
exists yet — a separate extraction is fetching it for wave C — and the
fidelity charter forbids guessing at a source statement that has not
been read. The two places those constants are *visible* in what we do
have (`GEN_OP eq (=) (R→R→Id) ⟹ …` and `SIDE_PRECOND (l'≠[]) ⟹ …` in
`p2-tutorial-extracts.md` §3) show their consuming position only, not
their definitions.

Also absent, for the same reason it is absent from `Relators.lean`
(delta R1): the source's `⟨i1,i2⟩⇩i` *notation* for iterated `intfAPP`.
`intfAPP` itself is ported verbatim; `relAPP`-style argument-tagging
syntax exists to defeat Isabelle's higher-order unifier and has no Lean
counterpart to defeat.

Interfaces are the *conceptual types* the identification phase assigns:
`i_std` for a type that needs no refinement, `i_nat`, `i_set`,
`⟨i_nat⟩i_graph`, `i₁ →ᵢ i₂`. They are one layer above the relators —
an interface says *what a term means*, a relator says *how it is
represented* — and fixing them first is what stops relator inference
from having to re-derive them (the Role paragraph in the header). -/

/-- Stand-in for the source's `typedecl interface` (delta T2): the free
term algebra over user-declared interface constants. The source's
`consts i_std :: interface` is `Interface.const "i_std"` here, and its
`consts i_graph :: interface ⇒ interface` is
`fun i => Interface.app (Interface.const "i_graph") i`. -/

deriving DecidableEq, Repr, Inhabited

`Relators.thy`'s `relAPP`. Ported verbatim (the *notation*
`⟨i1,i2⟩⇩i` around it is not — delta T5). Untagged, exactly as in the

construction. -/

`c::⇩i I ≡ True`: "the constant `c` has been declared to have interface
`I`". The proposition carries no information — it is a *declaration*,
read off the shape of the tagged term, which is why the source makes it

/-! ### The executable gate (design record ledger D4)

The tag layer has no content to refute — every definition here is a
definitional identity, and its unfolding lemma is `rfl`. What *can* go
wrong is the notation: a precedence that parses the wrong tree, or a
token that shadows another. So the gate checks the parse, not the
math — each `example` states the tagged form and the untagged form and
asks `simp` (i.e. the `autoref_tag_defs` set) to identify them, which it
can only do if the tagged form parsed as intended. -/
