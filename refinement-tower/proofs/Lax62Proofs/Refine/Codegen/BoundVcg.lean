The bounds pass: a verification-condition generator for
`∃ s' κ, Ir.BigStepB B c s s' κ`.

**This file is ours** (ledger **D3**); its specification is the last
paragraph of `plans/word-ram/refinement-tower/p5-codegen-design.md` §5,
"the bound is a genuine per-program obligation".

## Why there is a second derivation at all

`hnRefine` (P4) delivers a *plain* run: its `natAssn` is deliberately
unbounded, matching the NREST layer above it, and the Isabelle source
owes no bound only because its concrete values are machine words,
bounded by their type. Ours are `ℕ`. The codegen boundary
(`Sim.lean`) consumes a `BigStepB`, so somebody has to prove that the
run's values stay below `B`, and that somebody is this file: a VCG over
the *deep* syntax tree, whose output is exactly the arithmetic the
abstract invariants already prove (`i + 1 ≤ n + 1 < B`).

Design record P5/D-a records the deliberate choice of the two-derivation
route over the source-faithful `wordAssn B` retrofit inside synthesis;
the telemetry that decides whether to revisit it is the *annotation
line count* per program, measured in `Examples/EndToEnd.lean`.

## The shape

`Runs B c s Q` is the goal — "`c` runs from `s` under the bound, and the
state it stops in satisfies `Q`". Everything is stated at it:

* `bwp B c Q` is a genuine weakest precondition for the *loop-free*
  fragment, computed by structural recursion on the syntax tree, with
  `bwp_sound` its one soundness theorem. Applying `bwp_sound` and
  unfolding is the whole of `ir_bound_vcg`: what is left is one
  definedness fact per cell touched and one `< B` fact per value
  created.
* `runs_while` is the loop rule, an invariant and a variant, proved by
  strong induction on the variant. A loop is the one place a VCG over a
  deep syntax tree cannot be a computation, so it is the one place a
  program pays an annotation.

The obligations are honest about which ops create values. `copy`,
`aget` and `aset` create none — they need no `< B` goal at all — and the
five *non-growing* arithmetic operators discharge theirs from the state
invariant alone (`apply_sub_lt` and friends below). What is left over is
`const`, `add`, `mul`, `shiftl`, the two bit-spreading operators at a
power-of-two bound, and the literals of guards: precisely the design
record's list.

## Judgment calls

**P5/D-aa — the VCG is a weakest precondition over the loop-free
fragment plus a rule at the loop, not an inductive `BSpec` calculus.**
The design record asks for "per-op lemmas … seq/ite composition … a
while rule … then a seed tactic". A Hoare-style calculus needs the
intermediate assertion of every `seq` to be guessed by the tactic; a
`wp` computes it. Since `Ir.Com` is a deep, *concrete* tree at every
call site, `bwp` reduces by `simp only [bwp]` to a single conjunction
with no metavariable anywhere, which is what makes `ir_bound_vcg` a
three-line macro rather than a search. The per-op lemmas of the record
are still there — they are the equations of `bwp`, and each is stated
and proved as a standalone `simp` lemma below.

**P5/D-ab — `bwp` at a `while` is the goal itself, not `False`.** A
weakest precondition for a loop is not computable, and the honest
options are to make the VCG fail there or to let it stop there. It
stops: `bwp B (.while b c) Q s` is *defined* as `Runs B (.while b c) s
Q`, so a loop nested inside straight-line code is left as a residual
goal in exactly the form `runs_while` closes, and `bwp_sound` stays a
theorem about the whole language rather than about a fragment.

**P5/D-ac — the bit operators are bounded at a power-of-two bound
only.** `Nat.land m n ≤ m` holds outright, so `and` is free; `lor` and
`xor` can exceed both arguments (`1 ||| 2 = 3`), and the standard bound
for them is `< 2 ^ k` when both arguments are. The design record's
"power-of-two convention" is therefore recorded as the *hypothesis* of
`apply_or_lt` / `apply_xor_lt` rather than as a global assumption on
`B`: a program that uses neither operator — both toys, and P7's BFS —
never sees it, and `B = 2 ^ w` is what the machine boundary supplies
anyway.

/-- `Runs B c s Q`: from `s`, the command `c` has a *bounded* run, and
the state it stops in satisfies `Q`. This is the bounds pass's goal
shape; `Sim.lean` consumes the derivation, and the final state is
pinned only as far as the invariants of the pass need it. -/

numeral, and a condition because both its operands are. -/

/-! ### The non-growing operators

Five of the nine arithmetic operators cannot leave the range their
arguments came from, so their `< B` obligation is discharged from
`StateBound` alone and never reaches the user. The remaining four —
`add`, `mul`, `shiftl`, and `or`/`xor` off a power-of-two bound — are
the genuine per-program goals (judgment call P5/D-ac). -/

The invariant is *not* forced to be `StateBound B` — that is a
consequence of `BigStepB.stateBound`, not a hypothesis — but in practice
a caller conjoins it, because that is where the guard's cell bounds and
the body's non-growing operators come from. -/
