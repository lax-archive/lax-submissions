The simulation theorem: an IR run compiles into an IMP+ run, and the
per-op cost account is cashed into IMP+'s single time unit.

**This file is ours** (ledger **D3**); its specification is
`plans/word-ram/refinement-tower/p5-codegen-design.md` §3.

## The price map

The tower keeps its currencies apart all the way down — a cost is a
*per-op account*, `ACost String ℕ`, and `Ir/Syntax.lean` gives one
currency per op precisely so that a cost vector records which arithmetic
a run did. Collapsing that account into one number happens exactly once,
here, and the exchange rate is what the embedded program actually pays:

| currency | `weight` | what IMP+ charges for the embedded op |
|---|---|---|
| `ir.skip` | 1 | `skip`: `1` |
| `ir.const` | 2 | `assign x (lit n)`: `1 + 1` |
| `ir.copy` | 2 | `assign x (var y)`: `1 + 1` |
| `ir.aget` | 3 | `assign x (get a (var i))`: `1 + 2` |
| `ir.aset` | 3 | `store a (var i) (var v)`: `1 + 1 + 1` |
| `ir.ite` | 4 | test: `1 + 3` |
| `ir.while` | 4 | test: `1 + 3` |
| each of the nine binop currencies | 4 | `assign x (bin op (var y) (var z))`: `1 + 3` |

The table of the design record is exact, not merely safe: every entry is
the IMP+ cost of the embedded op **on the nose**, so `k ≤ cash κ` below
is in fact an equality for every derivation, and the constant factor the
tower loses at codegen is `4`. (The inequality is what is stated, because
that is what `Run`/`Spec` consume and because a later change of the
embedding should not have to be exact to stay sound.) The gate at the end
of the file pins the two sides against each other for three programs.

## The theorem

```
Ir.BigStepB B c s s' κ → Ir.StateBound B s → agree s σ →
  ∃ σ' k, Imp.BigStepB B (embed c) σ σ' k ∧ agree s' σ' ∧ k ≤ cash κ
        ∧ σ'.inp = σ.inp ∧ σ'.out = σ.out
```

by induction on the bounded IR derivation. The three hypotheses each do
one job: the bounded derivation supplies the `< B` facts at the two
value-creation sites and at the guards, the state invariant supplies them
everywhere a value is merely *moved* (`copy`, `aget`, `aset`, and the
cells of a guard) and is carried along the induction by
`BigStepB.stateBound`, and agreement supplies the values themselves. The
two tape clauses are not decoration: the IR has no tape ops (ledger note
N3), so a compiled IR run is exactly the part of a harnessed program that
leaves the tapes alone, which is what wave A2's prelude/epilogue lemmas
compose against.

## Judgment calls

**P5/D-k — `cash` is a function `Codegen.cash`, not dot notation on the
cost.** The design record writes `κ.cash`. `Ir.Cost` is an `abbrev` for
`ACost String ℕ`, so dot notation on it resolves against `ACost`, and a
declaration `ACost.cash` would put an IR-specific price map — one that
mentions `Ir.Currency.all` — into the generic cost-algebra namespace two
directories up. `cash κ` is written out instead; nothing else changes.

**P5/D-l — the price map is total, `0` off the IR's sixteen
currencies.** `weight` is a function `String → ℕ` and `cash` sums over
`Currency.all`, so a currency outside the IR's own set is priced at zero
and, being outside the sum, contributes nothing either way. No support
lemma about IR costs is therefore needed anywhere: `cash` is additive
(`cash_add`) and its value on each per-op singleton is a numeral
(`cash_cost_*`), and those two facts carry the whole induction.

/-! ### The gate (ledger D4)

The price map is an arithmetic claim about two semantics, so it is
checked against both: the IR side by the executable twin of
`Ir/Semantics.lean` (`#guard` on `cash` of the cost vector the evaluator
computes), the IMP+ side by an explicit bounded derivation whose cost the
constructors fix. The three programs are `Ir/Semantics.lean`'s own gate
programs — straight-line arithmetic, an array roundtrip, and a loop —
so the two sides are run on literally the same code.

Then two negative controls: a price map with the binop weight lowered to
three, shown to under-cover a real run; and the guard-literal program of
`BigStepB.lean`'s judgment call P5/D-i, shown to have no bounded IMP+ run
at all. -/
