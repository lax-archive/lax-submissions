P5's acceptance: P4's two toy programs, landed at `ComputesInTime`.

The plan's P5 gate is "P4's toy programs land at `computesInTime`
mechanically". This file is that landing, for both of them, with nothing
between the synthesized `Ir.Com` and the machine that is not one of the
five components of the design record.

Per program the chain is

```
sepref_synth  ──▶  hnRefine Γ c Γ' d R (irWhileIT …)      [P4, imported]
abstract loop ──▶  irWhileIT … ≤ SPEC (· = twin) T        [§1 here]
bounds pass   ──▶  ∃ s' κ, Ir.BigStepB B c s₀ s' κ        [§3, ir_bound_vcg]
cashing       ──▶  Reasoning.Spec B (agree s₀) (embed c) … N   [Cash.lean]
harness       ──▶  Spec B (· = initEnv ext x) (whole) … K      [Harness.lean]
boundary      ──▶  Transfer.Solves ──▶ ComputesInTime           [Cash.lean]
```

## Judgment calls

**P5/D-ag — the loop's constant cells are initialised by the harness,
not by the IR.** Both synthesized programs need cells the marshalling
prelude leaves at zero: filter-count owns `"one" ↦ᵥ 1`, reverse owns
that and `"j" ↦ᵥ |ys| - 1`. The prelude reads *input*, so somebody has
to write them. Doing it with IR `const` ops would mean composing another
`hnRefine` in front of the synthesized one — a synthesis problem, not a
codegen one — so it is done with two IMP+ assignments instead,
`Spec.assign`, priced at `2` and `4`. The constants are marshalling: an
`Ir.Com` that owns a cell holding `1` is a program whose caller supplies
it, exactly as `Γ` says.

**P5/D-ah — the abstract cost is an *exact* fuel recursion, not a
closed form.** `fcTotal`/`rvTotal` are defined by recursion on the
iteration budget and the loop lemma is `≤ SPEC (· = twin) (fun _ =>
total m)`; `ecash_fcTotal` then evaluates the price to `20·m + 4` in one
induction. Doing it the other way — a closed-form `ECost` and a
`nsmul` — makes the loop induction carry an arithmetic side condition at
every step for no gain.

**P5/D-ai — the value function of the `ComputesInTime` statement is the
program's own executable twin.** For filter-count that is `fcCount`,
which §5 `#guard`s equal to `(xs.filter (· < t)).length` — an
independent decider — on every sample. For reverse it is `rvOutFn`,
`#guard`ed equal to `List.reverse`. Proving those equalities is
functional correctness of the *examples*, which P4's own backlog (i)
already records as out of scope: P4's gate is the synthesis and P5's is
the codegen, and neither is a statement about `List.reverse`. The
backlog entry is carried forward at the end of this file.

**P5/D-aj — the value bound is `B x = x.sum + 2` for both programs.**
`Solves` wants a bound as a function of the input. Every value either
program creates is an entry of the array, an index into it, a count of
its entries, or the threshold — all bounded by the sum of the input,
which is also the cheapest bound to *state*. It is not tight and does
not need to be: `Transfer`'s word-length hypothesis is
`L.span (B x) ≤ 2 ^ w`, and a caller who wants `w = O(log n)` writes a
sharper `B` and re-runs §3 with the same invariants.

/-! ## 9. The gates (ledger D4)

Both programs are *run on the machine*, at the word length the transfer
theorem is stated at, and what comes off the output tape is `#guard`ed
against the value function — together with the step count against the
cost the theorems above claim. Each has a negative control.

The value functions are also checked against independent specifications
(`List.filter`, `List.reverse`), which is the honest reading of judgment
call P5/D-ai. -/

/-! ## 11. Telemetry (the plan's P5 gate numbers)

* **The gate.** Both P4 toys reach `Transfer.Solves` and
  `ComputesInTime` on the endorsed boundary, with no `sorry` and no
  axiom beyond `propext`, `Classical.choice`, `Quot.sound`:
  - `fc_computesInTime : ComputesInTime w (compileProgram fcLayout fcProgram) fcD fcOut
    (fun x => fcLayout.const * fcK x)`, `fcK x = 32·n + 17`;
  - `rv_computesInTime : ComputesInTime w (compileProgram rvLayout rvProgram) rvD rvOut'
    (fun x => rvLayout.const * rvK x)`, `rvK x = 12·n + 26·(n−1) + 11·n + 24`
    — that is `49·n − 2` for `n ≥ 1`, and `24` at `n = 0`, where the
    truncated subtraction of the loop's iteration budget bites. The four
    summands are left unsummed because each is one phase's lemma.

* **Authored lines.** A nesting-aware scan of this file: 990 physical,
  110 blank, 231 comment, **649 authored** — for two whole chains,
  including the abstract cost lemmas, the initial-state construction,
  the cashing, the harness assembly, the boundary and the gates.

* **Lines of *bounds* annotation** — the number the P7 `wordAssn`
  decision turns on. Everything that exists only because
  `BoundVcg.lean` has to be fed, per program:
  - filter-count: `fcB` 1, `fcInv` 5, `fcVar` 1, `FcBounds` 4,
    `FcBounds.one` 2, `fc_guard` 7, `fc_runs` 48, `fcBounds_holds` 12,
    `fc_stateBound` 12 — **92 lines**;
  - reverse: `RvBounds` 3, `rvInv` 6, `rvVar` 1, `rv_guard` 8,
    `rv_runs` 43, `rvBounds_holds` 9, `rv_stateBound` 11 — **81 lines**.
  Together **173 of 649**, about **27 %** of the end-to-end authored
  cost. But the *annotation proper* — the loop invariant, the variant
  and the record of what the bound has to satisfy — is only **10 lines
  per program**; the other ~70 are the *discharge*
  (`fc_runs` / `rv_runs` re-establishing the invariant, plus
  `…Bounds_holds` and `…_stateBound` instantiating it at `B x`).

* **What a `wordAssn B` retrofit would actually buy.** Of `fc_runs`'s 48
  lines, six are `< B` facts (`heB`, `htB`, `honeB`, `hkB`, `haccB`,
  `haccB0`) and one is the guard; the remaining ~40 re-establish the
  loop invariant — which a bounded assertion would still have to
  establish, only inside synthesis instead of after it. `apply_sub_lt`
  already removes reverse's only subtraction obligation outright, and no
  `copy`/`aget`/`aset` produced a goal at all. **Recommendation to P7:
  do not thaw P4.** The retrofit trades ~10 authored lines per program
  for a `wordAssn` side condition in every arithmetic hnr rule, and the
  70 lines it does *not* remove are the ones that cost time.

* **Wall clock**, warm build, `lake env lean` on single files (the
  import-only baseline is given for each, so the difference is
  elaboration):
  - `BoundVcg.lean` 4.8 s (baseline 3.7 s) — **1.1 s**;
  - `Cash.lean` 4.6 s (baseline 3.7 s) — **0.9 s**;
  - this file 7.3 s (baseline 4.3 s) — **3.0 s** for *both* end-to-end
    chains, gates and machine runs included.

* **Refute before prove.** The cost arithmetic was checked for direction
  before it was proved: `Cash.lean` §5 pins that `ecash` and `cash`
  agree on a lifted account (so `cash κ ≤ ecash T` is tight, not slack
  the wrong way) at `Ir/Semantics.lean`'s own countdown, and the two
  `#guard`s of §9 above check the *machine* step count against
  `L.const · K` on real runs of both compiled programs. No inequality
  came out backwards. Negative controls: one per program in §9, plus
  `BoundVcg.lean`'s `no_runs_bigConst` and `Sim.lean`'s two.

* **Backlog.**
  (i) The value functions are the programs' twins (P5/D-ai): that
  `fcCountOf ys t = (ys.filter (· < t)).length` and
  `rvOutFn ys = ys.reverse` are `#guard`ed, not proved. Both are
  loop-invariant arguments about `List`, independent of the tower;
  P4's backlog (i) records the same for reverse.
  (ii) `fcB` is shared by both programs (`x.sum + 2` either way). If P7
  wants a sharper word-length hypothesis, the place to change it is
  `fcB` and the two `…Bounds_holds` lemmas; §3 and §7 are unchanged.
  (iii) The `Spec.frame` step that carries `"n"` past reverse's loop
  (`rv_body_spec`, phase 3) is the only `∗`-free frame written by hand
  at the IMP+ level; a `Spec` combinator for "this phase writes none of
  these cells" would remove it.
  (iv) `omega` does not see through the reducible abbreviation
  `Ir.Val = ℕ` when it is a variable's declared type. Every invariant
  above therefore binds its indices at `ℕ` explicitly. A `Val`-aware
  `omega` preprocessing step, or making `Val` a plain `def` with a
  `simp` unfolding, would remove the trap; it cost an hour to find and
  is invisible at the call site.
