/-!
The I/O harness: the prelude and the epilogue an IR program is wrapped
in so that it can be handed to `Transfer.Solves`.

The tower's programs have no tapes. `Ir.Com` reads and writes named
cells and named arrays and nothing else, and the code generator turns
one IR op into one IMP+ command, so what comes out of it is a *body*: a
command that computes with cells and arrays but never touches `inp` or
`out`. What `Transfer.Solves` asks for is a command that runs from
`initEnv ext x` — the input sitting on the tape, every array of the
length `ext` declares, every scalar zero — and leaves `f x` on the
output tape. The difference between the two is marshalling, and this
file is the marshalling, proved once in the `Spec` interface of
`Spec.lean` so that no program pays for it again.

Nothing here mentions the IR. The file lives under `Refine/Codegen/`
and in the `Codegen` namespace because that is the component it belongs
to, but it imports only the IMP+ kit; wave B's cashing theorem is where
the two halves meet.

### The four pieces

* **`readScalars xs`** — one `read` per name, in order. This is the
  whole of the scalar prelude: the input's first `|xs|` entries land in
  the cells `xs` names, at a cost of `|xs| + 1`.
* **`readArr a x m tmp`** — a counted scan filling the array `a` from
  the tape, as many entries as the cell `m` holds, with `x` the counter
  and `tmp` the cell the `read` lands in. The loop is
  `Spec.forRangeZero`'s and the body's store and counter bump are
  `Lib.Fill.put`'s, so what is new here is only the tape: the invariant
  carries `inp = ys.drop i ++ rest`, and the `read` is the one command
  of the body `Fill` does not already own. Cost `12·n + 6`.
* **`writeScalar r`** — one `write`, cost `2`.
* **`writeArr a x m`** — the entries of `a` below what `m` holds,
  appended to the output in index order; again a `Spec.forRangeZero`
  scan, cost `11·n + 6`.

### Two conventions, pinned here

*The array is pre-sized, never allocated.* `initEnv ext x` gives the
array `a` the length `ext a`, and `ext` is chosen per input by whoever
uses the simulation theorem — an algorithm sizes its arrays by what it
reads. The prelude therefore does not create the array; it *fills* an
array that already has the right length, by `store`, and the
correspondence `ext a = ys.length` is a hypothesis of every lemma below
that reads one. An IR `aset` requires its cell to exist, so this is
also what makes a generated body run at all.

*The length lives in a cell.* `Spec.forRangeZero` tests `x < m` on two
scalars, so the number of array entries to read is whatever the cell
`m` holds — which for the shapes below is one of the scalars the
prelude has just read. That is the length-prefixed input convention of
the repo, stated as a membership `(m, ys.length) ∈ xs.zip vs` rather
than as a separate argument.

P5/D-s: the design record sketched the array prelude as `readArr a n`
with the count a function `n : Env → ℕ` of the state. It is a cell
instead, because the loop rule of `Spec.lean` compares two *scalars* and
a state function would have to be materialized into one anyway — at
which point the caller owes the same membership, one command later and
with the cost of the assignment on top.

### The marshal descriptors

`ScalarsIn` and `ScalarsArrIn` say what a prelude leaves behind: the
named cells hold the input's entries, every other cell is still zero,
the arrays are what `ext` declared except the one that was filled, and
both tapes are where marshalling put them. They are the *interface* of
this file — a body's specification is written against one of them, and
the three glue lemmas at the end turn such a specification into a
statement about `initEnv`. Keeping them small is deliberate: everything
a body could want to know about its initial state is here, and nothing
else is promised.

### The three stock shapes

`marshal_scalars_scalar`, `marshal_scalarsArr_scalar` and
`marshal_scalarsArr_arr` are the design record's three descriptors,
each one `Spec` from `fun σ => σ = initEnv ext x` to `σ'.out = f x`
with the body's own specification as its single interesting hypothesis.
The body is asked for exactly two things: that it computes from the
descriptor, and that it is syntactically `NoWrite` — a generated body
has no `write` in it, so the second is `by decide` at every call site,
and the harness owes the output tape to nobody else.

/-! ### A list as a cell function

`Fill` states what an array holds as `arrOf n g` for a cell function
`g`; the harness states it as the list of values that were read. These
two are the bridge, and it is needed in both directions: a list of
length `n` *is* an `arrOf`, and an entry of a list is a `getD`. -/

/-- **The scalar prelude.** Started on a tape beginning with `vs`, one
entry per name, the prelude leaves each named cell holding its entry and
the tape advanced past them. The names have to be distinct: they are
read in order, and a name read twice would keep only its second entry.

The frame condition on the cells rides in the postcondition rather than
being left to `Spec.frame`, because the induction needs it one step at a
time — the head cell survives the tail only because the tail cannot
assign to it.

The cost is `|xs| + 1`: one for each `read`, and one for the `skip` the
recursion ends in (P5/D-q: the recursion is `foldr`-shaped rather than
special-casing the singleton, so the constant is `+1` and every caller
carries it; a marshalling constant is not worth a second equation). -/

/-! ### The three stock shapes

Each of these is the design record's marshal descriptor, assembled: the
prelude establishes the descriptor, the body computes from it, the
epilogue puts the answer on the tape, and what comes out is one `Spec`
from `initEnv`. The body's own specification is the only interesting
hypothesis; the rest are the distinctness and pre-sizing side conditions
the preludes already asked for.

P5/D-r: the body is asked for `Com.NoWrite` and nothing else about the
tapes. A body that read the (empty) input tape could not get a
derivation, so `¬ body.reads` would be a hypothesis with no work to do;
`NoWrite` is the one the output-tape frame needs, and on generated
syntax it is `by decide`. -/

/-! ### The gates

The specifications above are read off the machine, not only proved: two
small programs built from the harness alone are compiled and run, and
what they leave on the output tape is `#guard`ed together with the
number of machine steps it took. The second gate carries a negative
control — the array epilogue writes the entries in index order, and the
reversal is pinned as *not* what comes out.

The step counts are also checked against the cost this file claims:
`compileProgram` costs at most `L.const` machine steps per unit of IMP+
cost, so `steps ≤ L.const * K` is a genuine cross-check of the constants
in the specifications above, and the one thing a `#guard` on the output
alone would not catch. -/
