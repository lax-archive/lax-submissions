/-!
The cashing theorem: from a synthesized `hnRefine` to a statement the
endorsed boundary consumes.

**This file is ours** (ledger **D3**); its specification is
`plans/word-ram/refinement-tower/p5-codegen-design.md` §5.

## What is being cashed

Four things arrive from four different places and have to be spent in
one transaction.

* **The program.** `hnRefine Γ c Γ' d R m` (P4) says that the deep
  `Ir.Com` `c`, started in any state satisfying `Γ`, runs and lands in
  `Γ' ∗ R ra d` — where `R ra d` is a conjunction of `natAssn` and
  `arrayAssn`, that is, *equations* pinning the result cells to the
  abstract result `ra`.
* **The cost.** `hnRefine` does not bound the run's cost outright: it
  says the run is affordable at the balance `cr + Ca` for some `Ca` the
  abstract program admits (`Ca ≤ M ra`). An abstract bound
  `m ≤ SPEC Φ T` therefore does two jobs at once — it bounds `Ca` by
  `T` and it gives `Φ ra`, the abstract postcondition.
* **The bound.** `BigStepB` is what `Sim.lean` consumes and `hnRefine`
  does not produce (design record §5, "the bound is a genuine per-program
  obligation"). `BoundVcg.lean` produces it, from the same initial
  state, and `BigStep.bigStepB_of_eq` — determinism — ties the two
  derivations to one execution without either being re-derived.
* **The exchange rate.** `Sim.lean`'s `cash` prices an IR cost account
  in IMP+ time units. Here it has to be applied to a *balance*
  (`ECost`, `ℕ∞`-valued) rather than to a run's account (`Cost`,
  `ℕ`-valued), so `ecash` is `cash`'s `ℕ∞` twin and `cash_le_ecash` is
  the one lemma that connects them.

## The two export shapes

**(a) `spec_of_hnRefine`** — the primary one, and the shape P7 consumes
(`bfs_spec` at `Lax3Proofs/RamBfs.lean:1064` is a cells-based
`Reasoning.Spec`, no tapes). Simulation only, no harness.

**(b) `solves_of_spec`** — the boundary wrapper: a `Reasoning.Spec` from
`initEnv`, per admissible input, is a `Transfer.Solves`, and
`Solves.computesInTime` finishes. The `initEnv`-shaped `Spec` is what
`Harness.lean`'s three marshal lemmas produce out of a body `Spec`, so
(b) is deliberately *not* re-parameterized over the marshal shapes: the
assembly is `marshal_… ▸ solves_of_spec`, three lines at a call site,
and no new abstraction between them.

## The cost arithmetic, in order

```
κ                            the IR run's account (BigStep)
  ≤ cr + Ca = Ca             affordability, at cr = 0        (hnRefine)
  ≤ T                        Ca ≤ M ra ≤ T                   (SPEC bound)
cash κ ≤ ecash T ≤ N         pricing, then the caller's numeral
```

Every step is an inequality in the safe direction and the first is the
only one that is not visibly so: `leCostECost κ (cr + Ca)` is *exactly*
"the run's account is affordable at that balance", so `cr = 0` is not a
weakening but the tightest choice — the initial credits a caller would
add can only make `κ ≤ cr + Ca` easier, never the conclusion stronger.
The toys' `Γ` owns no `¤¤` conjunct at all, so `cr = 0` is also the only
balance at which `irSTATE (Γ ∗ F) (s₀, cr)` holds (judgment call
P5/D-ae).

## Judgment calls

**P5/D-ad — the initial balance is fixed at `0`, not quantified.**
`hnRefine` quantifies over `cr`; a caller who owns credits could pass
them and get a larger `Ca` allowance. Nothing wants that here: the
credits an abstract program needs are the ones `Ca` accounts for, and a
`Γ` carrying `¤¤` conjuncts would have to *spend* them inside the
program, which for a synthesized program means they were part of the
abstract cost already. Fixing `cr = 0` removes a parameter from every
downstream statement; a future consumer that needs it restates the
theorem with `cr` free and changes `zero_add` to nothing.

**P5/D-ae — the abstract bound is `m ≤ NRest.spec Φ (fun _ => T)`, a
constant-cost `SPEC`.** The source's `SPEC P t` has `t : α → γ`. A
result-dependent bound would make the conclusion's `N` depend on `ra`,
which is existentially quantified in the `Spec` postcondition and so
cannot appear in the cost. A caller with a result-dependent bound takes
the supremum first; that is what a cost bound *is* at this boundary.

**P5/D-af — the readout is a hypothesis, not a shape.** The design
record asks for "the two destination shapes the toys need". Both are
instances of one hypothesis, `hQ`, which is handed the final `irSTATE`
and the agreeing environment and asked for whatever the caller wants to
know. A scalar destination discharges it with `ptoVar_vars` and
`agree.var`, an array destination with `ptoArr_arrs` and `agree.arr`;
`readout_scalar` and `readout_arr` below are those two discharges,
stated once so that a call site is one line either way.

/-! ## 1. Pricing a balance

`cash` prices a *run's* account, `Ir.Cost = ACost String ℕ`. A bound on
that account is a bound in `ECost = ACost String ℕ∞`, so the price map
has to be applied there too. `ecash` is the same sum in `ℕ∞`, and
`cash_le_ecash` is the only lemma about it that the cashing theorem
uses; the rest is the arithmetic a caller needs to evaluate `ecash` on a
concrete cost expression.

(`Ir.Val` is a reducible abbreviation of `ℕ`, but `omega` does not see
through it when it is the *declared* type of a variable, so every
statement below that a caller will feed to `omega` is written at `ℕ`.
This is a Lean quirk, not a design decision, and it is recorded here
because it is invisible at the call site and costs an hour to find.) -/

re-deriving it means re-running the adequacy chain by hand. So the
projection is published: same three hypotheses, the run and nothing
else. It is stated separately rather than as an extra conclusion of
`spec_of_hnRefine` because the two are used in the opposite order — the

`Transfer.Solves` is three facts: the program compiles under the layout,
admissible inputs fit under the bound, and on every admissible input the
program runs from `initEnv` to the answer within the cost. The third is
exactly what `Harness.lean`'s marshal lemmas produce, so the wrapper is
a repackaging and nothing more.

The array lengths `ext` are chosen per input — an algorithm sizes its
arrays by what it reads, and `Solves` quantifies them existentially for
that reason — so they are existential here too. -/

/-! ## 5. Refute before prove

Before any of the above was proved, the cost arithmetic was checked to
run in the right direction on a concrete execution — the design record's
`cash κ ≤ credits` chain is an inequality, and an inequality proved in
the wrong direction is a theorem about nothing.

The check: `Ir/Semantics.lean`'s `countdown` at `n = 2` costs
`2·ir.const-free` … the account its evaluator computes, cashed, is `22`
(`Sim.lean`'s gate), and the balance a caller would have to supply for
the run to be affordable is that same account lifted into `ℕ∞`. So
`ecash` of the lifted account is `cash` of the account — the two price
maps agree where both apply — and the inequality `cash κ ≤ ecash T` is
*tight* at `T = lift κ`, not slack in the wrong direction. -/

section Refute

/-- The lift of a run's account into a balance: what a caller who
supplies exactly the run's cost owns. -/
