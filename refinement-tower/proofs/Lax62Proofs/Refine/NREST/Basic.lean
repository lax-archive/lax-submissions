The NREST monad: nondeterministic results carrying a resource valuation.

Port of the core of `thys/nrest/NREST.thy` of `isabelle_llvm_time`
(Haslbeck–Lammich, ESOP'21 artifact) at the pin recorded in
`plans/word-ram/refinement-tower/design.md` §1,
github.com/lammich/isabelle_llvm_time @ 42dd7f5; the AFP `NREST` entry
(Isabelle2025-2) carries the same core. The verbatim source is quoted in
`plans/word-ram/refinement-tower/source-extracts.md`:

```isabelle
datatype ('a,'b) nrest = FAILi | REST "'a ⇒ ('b::{complete_lattice,monoid_add}) option"
"RETURNT x ≡ REST (λe. if e=x then Some 0 else None)"
"SPEC P t = REST (λv. if P v then Some (t v) else None)"
fun less_eq_nrest where
  "_ ≤ FAILi ⟷ True" | "(REST a) ≤ (REST b) ⟷ a ≤ b" | "FAILi ≤ (REST _) ⟷ False"
"consume M t ≡ case M of FAILi ⇒ FAILT | REST X ⇒ REST (map_option ((+) t) o (X))"
"bindT M f ≡ case M of FAILi ⇒ FAILT | REST X ⇒ Sup {consume (f x) t1 |x t1. X x = Some t1}"
"iASSERT ret Φ ≡ if Φ then ret () else top"   "ASSERT ≡ iASSERT RETURNT"
```

## Substrate decisions

**The result map.** Isabelle's `'a ⇒ 'b option`, ordered pointwise with
`None` at the bottom, *is* mathlib's `α → WithBot γ`: `WithBot γ` is
`Option γ` with exactly that order, and mathlib already proves it a
complete lattice, as it proves `α → _` one. So the entire lattice
structure of result maps is imported rather than re-derived, and only
the `FAILi`-on-top layer is built here. This is the substrate decision
fixed by the supervisor for P1; it is a change of *spelling*, not of
content — `Some t` reads `(t : WithBot γ)` and `None` reads `⊥`.

**Class constraints.** HOL puts sort constraints
`'b :: {complete_lattice, monoid_add}` on the datatype itself. Lean's
natural rendering puts them on the *operations*: `NRest α γ` is
class-free, and `returnT` asks for `Zero γ`, `consume` for `Add γ`,
`bindT` for `CompleteLattice γ` and `Add γ`, exactly as much as each
needs. One type therefore carries the `ℕ`-valued and the `ℕ∞`-valued
uses without duplication, and the monomorphic statements the source
makes at `enat` (see `Pw.lean`) can be stated at their own carriers.

**The complete lattice.** `NRest α γ` is order-isomorphic to
`WithTop (α → WithBot γ)`, but mathlib has no
`CompleteLattice (WithTop β)` instance for a complete lattice `β` (only
the `WithBot` direction and the mixed `WithTop (WithBot _)` one), so
there is nothing to transport across. The instance is therefore built
the source's own way: `sSup` is defined by the source's formula
(`FAILi` if it occurs in the set, otherwise the pointwise supremum of
the result maps), and `completeLatticeOfSup` turns the `IsLUB` proof
into the lattice. `⊤`, `⊥`, `⊔`, `⊓` are supplied explicitly rather
than left to that constructor's set-comprehension defaults, so that
`⊤ = fail` and `⊥ = rest ⊥` hold by `rfl` and the binary operations are
plain matches rather than suprema over set comprehensions — which is
what makes the sanity layer's executable twins one-line agreements
(design record ledger D4).

Per design record §10.2 both parameters stay in `Type`; no universe
polymorphism until a consumer forces it.

result". -/

The idiom `λe. if e = x then _ else None` occurs in `RETURNT`, in
`consume_RETURNT` and in the definition of `inresT`; it is named once
here. The `if` is classical, as HOL's is — the price is that the
operations built from it are `noncomputable`, and the sanity layer
bridges to a `DecidableEq`-based twin. -/

The source's one-result "pay this and continue" computation, and the
rewriting of `consume` as a bind against it. `consumea` sits in
`NREST.thy` next to `consume`, which is why it sits here; P1 defined it
in `Combinators.lean` because this file was frozen for that slice
(`Combinators.lean`'s decision C6), and P2 wave A moved it up.

The two *statements* are P1's, unchanged. `consume_alt2`'s **proof** had
to change: P1 proved it through `Pw.lean`'s `bindT_rest_eq_iSup`, which
sits above this file, so the same fact is read off `bindT_rest`'s own
set comprehension instead — at `Unit` that comprehension is a singleton,
which is what P1's `iSup_unique` step was also using. -/
