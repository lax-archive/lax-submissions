Backwards reasoning for `NREST`: the `gwp` predicate transformer and the
seed of the abstract VCG.

Port of `thys/nrest/NREST_Backwards_Reasoning.thy` and
`thys/nrest/NREST_Type_Classes.thy` of `isabelle_llvm_time`
(Haslbeck–Lammich, ESOP'21 artifact) at the pin recorded in
`plans/word-ram/refinement-tower/design.md` §1,
github.com/lammich/isabelle_llvm_time @ 42dd7f5, together with
`lift_acost` from `thys/cost/Enat_Cost.thy` and the `RECT` induction
principles of `thys/nrest/NREST.thy` that `Rec.lean` deferred to this
file. `thys/nrest/NREST_Automation.thy` was read for the automation
architecture (`Named_Thms` `refine_vcg` / `refine_vcg_cons` / `refine0`
/ `refine` / `refine2`, and `refine_rcg`); its `sc_solve` cost-side-
condition solver and its normalisation lemma collections are P2 material
and are not ported here. Everything fetched 2026-07-29 from the pins.

## Substrate deltas, each flagged

**B1 — the source's `minus` is not mathlib's `Sub`, and the difference
is load-bearing.** Isabelle's `enat` subtraction is
`a - b = (case a of enat x ⇒ (case b of enat y ⇒ enat (x-y) | ∞ ⇒ 0) | ∞ ⇒ ∞)`,
so `∞ - ∞ = ∞`; mathlib's `Sub ℕ∞` is truncated subtraction, so
`⊤ - ⊤ = 0` (checked by `#guard` in the gate below). The `needname`
axiom `top_absorb : top - a = top` is exactly this point, and the whole
`gwp` theory rests on it. **Under mathlib's `-` the ported
`minus_p_m_bindT` is false**: take `α = β = Unit`, `m = REST [() ↦ ⊤]`,
`f () = REST (λ_. None)`; then `bindT m f = REST (λ_. None)` so the
left-hand side is `t ≤ Some ⊤`, always true, while the right-hand side
is `t ≤ minus_cost (Some ⊤) (Some ⊤) = Some (⊤ - ⊤) = Some 0`, false for
`t = Some 1`. HOL's `minus` is its own type class; ours is `ResSub`,
written `-ᵣ`, and mathlib's `Sub` is left alone. This is a *refutation
found while porting*, and it is the one place where taking mathlib's
"obvious" operation would have silently broken the calculus.

**B2 — resolved: the cost-carrier material moved to `ACost.lean`.** The
source's `minus_acost_alt` and the `times_acost_def` of its
`acost :: needname_zero` instantiation belong beside the other pointwise
operations, but `ACost.lean` was frozen for P1's third slice, so
`ResSub` itself, `ACost.instResSub`, `ACost.instSub`, `ACost.instMul`
and `ACost.toFun_iInf` were declared here. **P2 wave A moved them up to
`Cost/ACost.lean`**, names, statements and proofs unchanged, together
with the `-ᵣ` notation, the `ℕ∞` instance, the `enat_resSub_*` lemmas
and the four `#guard`s recording delta B1's counterexample. This file
uses them all through its existing import chain; nothing stated here
changed. What stays is what `NREST_Type_Classes.thy` puts here: the
classes `Nonneg` / `Needname` / `Drm` / `NeednameZero` and their `enat`
and `acost` instances.

**B3 — HOL sort constraints become instance parameters.** HOL bundles
the operations into the class (`class needname = complete_lattice +
minus + plus + …`); Lean takes them as instance arguments
(`class Needname (γ) [CompleteLattice γ] [ResSub γ] [Add γ]`). This is
the adaptation `Basic.lean` already made for `nrest`'s sort constraints,
and it is the smallest one that works: the assumption *lists* are the
source's, one field per assumption, under the source's names. Two
assumptions could not be restated as fields:
`ordered_comm_monoid_add` is mathlib's `AddCommMonoid` + `PartialOrder`
+ `IsOrderedAddMonoid` (the bundled class was retired) and it already
*proves* `needname_plus_absorb : 0 + x = x`, so that assumption is a
theorem here; and `mult_zero` would be mathlib's `MulZeroClass`, which
bundles its own `Zero` and would diamond with `AddCommMonoid`'s, so its
two axioms are fields of `NeednameZero` instead.

**B4 — definitions carry `CompleteLattice γ` + `ResSub γ` throughout.**
The source gives `minus_cost` the finer sort `{minus, ord, top}` and
adds `complete_lattice` per lemma. `WithBot γ`'s order is only a lattice
at complete-lattice strength, and every use in the tower is at one, so
the finer gradation buys nothing here and is not reproduced.

**B5 — nonemptiness side conditions.** HOL types are nonempty by
construction; Lean's need not be. Three ported statements are false at
an empty result type and carry `[Nonempty _]`: `gwp_FAILT` (`gwp FAILT Q`
is `⨅ x : α, ⊥`, which is `⊤` when `α` is empty), `gwp_specifies_I`, and
`minus_p_m_bindT` — hence `gwp_bindT`, which needs both result types
nonempty, and `minusPM_iInf`, which needs the index type nonempty. The
`≥` half of the bind rule that the VCG actually uses (`le_gwp_bindT`,
`gwp_bindT_I`) needs only the *bound* computation's type.

**B6 — the loop-rule chain is shortened.** The source reaches its
`[vcg_rules']` entry `While` through `whileT_rule'''` → `whileIET_rule`
→ `whileIET_rule'`, each a repackaging of the previous one under a
different spelling of the invariant, with `gwp_conseq4` applied twice.
`While` here is derived from `gwp_whileT_rule_wf` directly, at the
invariant-plus-energy instantiation
`Iw s = (if I s ∧ E s ≤ E s0 then Some (t + lift_acost (E s0 - E s)) else None)`,
which is the composite of the source's three steps. The endpoints —
`gwp_whileT_rule_wf` and `While` — are stated exactly as the source
states them; only the intermediate spellings are absent. `gwp_conseq4`
*is* ported (with its `aux2`/`aux3`), because it is a citable
consequence rule in its own right.

**B7 — the attribute cannot be used in the module that declares it.**
Lean runs `initialize` blocks at *import* time, so `@[refine_vcg]` is
unavailable to this file. The ported rules therefore sit in
`RefineVcg.coreRules`, a list the tactic tries first, and
`@[refine_vcg]` extends that set from downstream modules — which is
where P2–P6's rules will live anyway. Isabelle's `named_theorems` has no
such restriction; this is a pure substrate cost, recorded rather than
worked around.

Inherited from the earlier slices and used unchanged: **F6** (result
maps are `α → WithBot γ`, so `Some t` reads `(t : WithBot γ)`, `None`
reads `⊥` and `Some top` reads `((⊤ : γ) : WithBot γ)`, which is
`WithBot γ`'s own `⊤`), **F1** (currency names are `String`), **C1**
(loop and branch conditions are `Bool`, so the source's `b` / `¬b`
premises read `b = true` / `b = false`).

## What is *not* ported, and why

* `gwp_SELECT_I` and `progress_SELECT_iff`: `SELECT` is not in the
  frozen `Basic.lean`/`Combinators.lean` API.
* The `monadic_WHILEIET` chain — `monadic_WHILE_rule''`,
  `monadic_WHILE_rule_real`, `neueWhile_rule''`,
  `neueWhile_rule''_real`, `gwp_monadic_WHILEIET`, and their vocabulary
  `Someplus` / `mm22` / `loopbody_cond` / `loopexit_cond` /
  `loop_body_condition` / `loop_exit_condition`. That chain is the loop
  rule for `monadic_WHILEIT` (a loop whose *condition* is itself a
  costed computation); the `whileIET` rule ported here is the one the P1
  acceptance program needs, and the monadic-condition variant follows
  the same argument with `MIf` in the middle. Deferred to the consumer
  that needs it.
* `progress_bind` and `progress_SELECT_iff` from the progress suite;
  `progress_REST_iff`, `progress_SPECT_emb` and `progress_ASSERT_bind`
  are ported, plus `progress_consume_returnT`, which is what loop bodies
  in the `consume`-of-`RETURNT` shape need.
* The `gwp⇩n` rule suite (`gwpn_bindT_I`, `gwpn_MIf_I`,
  `gwpn_monadic_WHILEIET`, …): `gwpn` itself and `gwpn_FAIL` are here,
  the rules wait for a consumer. They are `gwp` rules plus a
  `nofailT` bookkeeping layer.
* The `inres` section (`inres`, `nofailT_bindT`, `gwp_mono_alt`, …):
  `Pw.lean` already carries `nofailT`/`inresT` and
  `pw_bindT_nofailT`; `inres` is the `t`-free projection of `inresT` and
  belongs beside them when it is ported. P1 ported *none* of that
  section, so P2 wave A's relocation pass found nothing to move: the
  `t`-free projection still awaits a port from the source text (whose
  statements are not in either extract file), and when it lands it lands
  in `Pw.lean`, not here.
* `VCG_Case_Splitter` (the ML case splitter) and `NREST_Automation`'s
  `sc_solve` / `norm_cost` / `norm_pp`: automation, P2 material.

## Tactic maturity (stated honestly, per the campaign brief)

`refine_vcg` is a *seed*, not the source's method. What it does: peel
syntactic binders, then apply the first rule of `RefineVcg.coreRules`
(the ported `[vcg_rules']` set, most specific first) or of the
`@[refine_vcg]` database whose conclusion matches, repeat over all
goals, and leave everything else as a goal. That is enough to drive a
`whileIET` program with a `consume`/`RETURNT`/`bindT`/`MIf`/`ASSERT`
body from `gwp_specifies_I` down to arithmetic side conditions — which
is what the demo at the bottom of this file exercises end to end.

What it does *not* do, all of which the source's `refine_vcg` does:
no DiscrTree indexing (rules are tried in list order, so the cost is
linear in the rule set — fine at ten rules, not at a hundred); no
`refine_vcg_split_case` (a goal about `gwp (case x of …) Q` is not split
on `x`); no `progress` prover (the `progress` side condition is left to
the user, where the source's `method progress` discharges it); no
side-condition solver (`sc_solve`) for the cost inequalities, which are
the bulk of what is left over; no `rules:` argument for ad-hoc rules at
the call site; no consequence-rule stage (`refine_vcg_cons`). Closing
those gaps is P2's `Autoref/Solver.lean` work (design record §3, ledger
D1), and the rule *format* here is already the one that work consumes.

## The executable gate

Ledger D4: `gwp` is `noncomputable` twice over (the classical `if`
inside `minus_cost`, and `sInf`), so the gate is the campaign's standard
executable-twin route — `minusCostE`, `gwpE`, each with a *proved*
agreement theorem, at `Sanity.lean`'s `NRest (Fin 3) ℕ∞`. The
`#guard`s and Plausible `#test`s at the bottom therefore check `gwp`
itself, including `gwp_bindT`, the hardest ported statement. The first
two `#guard`s are the recorded counterexample of delta B1.

Design record §3 (`named_theorems → persistent attribute + DiscrTree`)

DiscrTree indexing, no case splitter, no `progress` prover, and no
side-condition solver.

**Substrate delta B7.** Lean forbids using an attribute in the module
that declares it (`initialize` values are not available to their own
module). The ported rules therefore sit in `RefineVcg.coreRules`, a list
the tactic tries first, and `@[refine_vcg]` extends that set from
*downstream* modules — which is where P2–P6's rules will live anyway.
Isabelle's `named_theorems` has no such restriction; this is a pure
substrate cost, recorded rather than worked around. -/

/-! ### The executable gate (design record ledger D4)

`gwp` is `noncomputable` twice over — the classical `if` inside
`minus_cost` and `sInf` — so the route is the campaign's standard one:
executable twins with *proved* agreement, so that a `#guard` about the
twin is a `#guard` about `gwp`. The carrier is `Sanity.lean`'s
`NRest (Fin 3) ℕ∞`.

The recorded counterexample of delta B1 — mathlib's `Sub ℕ∞` and
Isabelle's `enat` subtraction disagree at `⊤ - ⊤`, which is exactly the
point the `needname` axiom `top - a = top` lives at — travelled with
`ResSub` to `Cost/ACost.lean` in P2 wave A (delta B2); it is the four
`#guard`s at the head of that file. -/

`gwp_specifies_I` + the `refine_vcg` tactic. The invariant and the

leaves is closed by `simp`/`omega`. -/
