# Trail-backed touched-only arrays — the D5 default array

The ND-MC campaign's touched-only-costs discipline (memory
`touched-only-costs.md`: "recursive per-arena RAM passes must charge
active sets from the FIRST brief; O(n) init × n arenas = n² kills
sublinear headlines") made a library object, as ledger D5 asks.

A trail array is a data array `A` of length `n`, a *trail* array `T` of
the same capacity recording which slots have been written since the last
reset, and a top-of-trail counter `t`. Reading is a plain read. Writing
writes and pushes the index. Resetting pops the trail, restoring each
touched slot to the default — so **the reset costs one pop per write
since the last reset, and nothing per untouched slot**. That is the
theorem this file exists for (§7).

The abstract type is `List Val × ℕ`: the array's contents, and the
*touch budget counter* `k` — the design record's "abstract cost carrier
that makes reset's touched-proportional cost sayable abstractly". `k` is
not an implementation detail leaking upward; it is the resource the
interface charges against, exactly as a credit balance is.

## Judgment calls

**P6/D-p — `k` counts *writes*, not *distinct touched slots*, and
`tset` therefore asserts `k < n`.** The trail is pushed
unconditionally: `tset` does not first test whether the slot is already
on the trail (that test is a read plus a branch per write, and it is not
what the source's trail structures do either). The consequence is that
the trail's capacity — which the design record fixes at `|xs|` — bounds
the number of writes *between resets*, not the number of distinct slots,
so `mop_tset`'s precondition includes `k < n`. A program that writes one
slot `n + 1` times between resets must reset in between. This is a real
restriction and it is the price of an unconditional push; the fallback
is a `cap` parameter decoupled from `|xs|`, which changes `trailAssn`'s
signature and nothing else.

**P6/D-q — the trail's *contents* are ghost state, the counter is not.**
`trailAssn` existentially owns the trail array and states the invariant
relating it to `(xs, k)`; the counter `k` is part of the abstract value
because reset's cost depends on it. Consequently `tget`/`tset`/`treset`
are proved at the raw three-cell assertion and lifted (P6/D-h), and no
consumer ever sees `T`'s contents.

**P6/D-r — `treset`'s implementation is synthesized, `tget`'s and
`tset`'s are too.** All three raw programs go through `sepref_synth`
from the primitive mops; the pop-loop needed no hand derivation from the
P4 combinator rules. What is *not* synthesized is the lift from the raw
three-cell assertion to `trailAssn` — that is `hnr_pre_ex_conv` +
`hnr_pre_pure_conv` + `hnRefine_res_cast'`, three lines per op, and it is
where the invariant is discharged.

**P6/D-s — the reset loop's invariant is the structure's own
well-formedness.** `irWhileIT` asserts its invariant at every iteration,
so the invariant is where the index bounds for the pop's read and write
come from (P4/D-ed). Making it `TrailWf` rather than something weaker is
free — the entry state satisfies it by the assertion, and preserving it
is the induction step of the value lemma anyway.

/-! ### The pop loop

Two things about its shape are forced by the pipeline and recorded as
flags.

**P6/D-t — the trail array stays in the *frame*, not in the loop
state.** `hnr_while_measured`'s body post is its frame, so everything the
body *mutates* must be in the state (P4/D-ec) — but `T` is only read by
the pop loop, so it is a frame conjunct and the loop state is the pair
`(xs, k)` at `(A, t)`. This is not cosmetic: with two arrays inside one
`prodAssn` state the frame matcher's split-and-permute step failed to
close, and with one it does.

**P6/D-u — the top is decremented twice: once into a scratch cell for
the read, once in place.** The pop needs the index `t - 1` in a *cell* to
read `T[t-1]`, and it needs the state's own `t` cell to end up holding
`t - 1`. `hnr_mop_binop` (destination = a junk cell) is tried before
`hnr_mop_binop_self` (in place) and the pipeline does not backtrack
across that choice, so a single `mopBinop` in the presence of a free
scratch cell always lands in the scratch cell — and then the loop state's
`t` is never updated. Writing the subtraction twice makes the choice
deterministic: the first has a scratch cell available and takes it, the
second does not and goes in place. The price is one extra `ir.sub` per
pop, which is still Θ(1) per *touch* and so does not affect the
characteristic theorem. Fallbacks, in preference order: a `mop_move`
whose destination is a live cell; making `hnr_mop_binop_self` take
priority; or making the operator phase backtrack. -/

/-- The guard: the trail is non-empty. A *structural* guard on the top
cell (P4/D-af), not a boolean operation — the design record's D6-P6-5
route, here for `treset`'s loop rather than for an `isEmpty` op. -/

/-! ## 6. The lifted rules (P6/D-h, D6-P6-3)

Three registered rules, one per interface op, each at caller-chosen cell
names and each stated at the composite assertion. This is the file's
`FCOMP`: the raw judgment goes in, `hnr_pre_ex_conv` +
`hnr_pre_pure_conv` discharge the ghost trail and the invariant on the
way in, `hnRefine_res_cast'` re-packs them on the way out. -/

/-! ## 7. The characteristic theorem — reset is touched-only

This is what the whole file is for. `treset`'s price is a function of
the touch counter alone: the array's length does not occur in it, so a
program that writes `k` slots of a length-`n` array and resets pays
Θ(k), not Θ(n). That is the ND-MC discipline
(`touched-only-costs.md`) as a *type*, not a review reminder. -/

/-! ## 8. Init from junk (design D6-P6-2, `Iicf/Basic.lean` §2)

The replacement for the source's `*_new`. There is no allocation: the
caller already owns three cells of the right capacity, holding junk, and
`tinit` is the program that makes the invariant true of them. Note what
it is built from — `mop_array_fill`'s **registered rule**, consumed here
exactly as a consumer would consume it, through the same pipeline. The
trail array is *never touched*: its contents are ghost (P6/D-q) and any
capacity-`n` junk satisfies the invariant at `k = 0`.

**P6/D-v — init takes the top cell already holding `0`, it does not zero
it.** Zeroing would be a `mopConstN 0` whose destination is a *fresh*
metavariable at the point the operator phase chooses a rule, so — by the
same rule-preference limitation as P6/D-u — it lands in whichever junk
cell comes first, which after the fill is the fill's own scratch index.
The tuple-forming step `mopPair ys 0` has no such problem: its
destination is the judgment's `d`, fixed by the goal. So init's
precondition asks for `hnCtxt natAssn 0 t`, which a caller owns anyway
(every program of this shape sets up its literal cells first), and the
`ir.const` disappears from `tinitCost`. Fallback: the same three as
P6/D-u. -/
