# P6 wave A acceptance — the exercises

The design record's acceptance criterion for a structure is: *an exercise
program written at the abstract layer and pushed through `sepref`
mechanically — zero bespoke tactics, zero hand frame clauses*. This file
is the two wave-A exercises, and the telemetry (§3) is the count.

* **Arrays** (§1): an in-place pass — fill the array with a constant,
  read a slot, bump it, write it back — consuming `mop_array_fill`'s
  registered rule together with the primitive `aget`/`aset`.
* **Trail arrays** (§2): write–reset–reuse across two rounds, with the
  round-2 reset's cost read off the round-2 touch counter and pinned
  against the array's length.

Neither program mentions an assertion, a frame, a cell permutation, a
`Com`, or a cost: they are `do`-blocks over the interface ops, and one
`sepref_synth` line each.

/-! ## 2. Trail arrays — write, reset, reuse

Two rounds over one trail array: three writes and a reset, then two
writes and a reset. The point of the exercise is the *second* reset:
its price is `resetCost 2`, which mentions the touch counter and not the
array's length.

The two rounds use the same cells throughout — nothing is allocated,
nothing is freed, and the reset is what makes the array reusable. -/

/-- **The exercise, at the abstract layer.** `s` is a trail array's
abstract value; `i` and `j` are two slots, written in the pattern
`i, j, i` and then `j, i`. -/

/-! ## 3. Telemetry (the phase's acceptance numbers)

* **Hand-written frame clauses in this file: 0.** Nothing here rewrites
  with `sepConj_assoc`, `sepConj_comm`, `ac_rfl` *on assertions*,
  `irSTATE_rot`, `fri`, `iicf_perm`, `hnRefine_pre_perm`,
  `hnRefine_frame` or `entails_of_eq`. The `∗`-lists in the two
  `sepref_synth` goals are *interface* — the cells the caller owns — and
  every permutation, split and frame that turns them into rule instances
  is inferred. The three `ac_rfl`-free `rw` chains in `bumpProg_value`
  are on `NRest` programs and `ECost` sums, not on `∗`.

* **Bespoke tactics: 0.** Two `sepref_synth` invocations, four
  `decide +kernel` cost pins, one `simp only` inside a value lemma.

* **Interface ops consumed: 5** — `mop_array_fill`, `mopAget`,
  `mopAset`, `mopBinop` (§1); `mop_tset`, `mop_treset` (§2) — of which
  three are P6 compound ops whose implementations were themselves
  synthesized (`Iicf/IicfArray.lean` §3, `Iicf/IicfTrailArray.lean` §3).

* **Axioms.** `#print axioms` is pinned above for both synthesized
  judgments: `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]` and nothing
  else. -/
