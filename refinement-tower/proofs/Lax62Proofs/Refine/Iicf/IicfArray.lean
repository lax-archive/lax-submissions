# Plain arrays — the interface completions (design record §"The structures" 1)

`arrayAssn` and the primitive `mopAget`/`mopAset` already exist
(`Sepref/IrOps.lean`); what an *interface* needs on top of them is the
compound operations, and the one this file adds is **fill**:
`mop_array_fill xs v` overwrites every entry of `xs` with `v`, as **one
interface op** with a closed-form linear cost (P6/D-j).

The point of the file is not the operation — it is *how it is produced*
(D6-P6-3):

```
primitive mops (mopAset, mopBinop, mopPair, mopConstN)
  ──sepref_synth──▶  fillLoop_impl : Ir.Com          (§3, pinned by #guard)
  ──fillLoop_value──▶ closed form consume (returnT …) fillCost   (§4)
  ──hnRefine_res_cast──▶ hnr_mop_array_fill @[sepref_fr_rules]   (§5)
  ──sepref──▶ consumed by an exercise with no hand frame work    (§6)
```

Nobody writes the implementation, and nobody writes the cost: `fillCost`
is read off what the pipeline spent.

## Judgment calls

**P6/D-l — the array-shape lemmas are reused from
`Refine/Examples/ArrayFill.lean`, not re-proved.** That file's `filled m
val xs = List.replicate m val ++ xs.drop m` and its three facts
(`filled_length`, `filled_set`, `filled_all`) are exactly the induction
step of the fill loop, landed in P3 and proved once. Standing practice
("landed proofs are capital") says thread them. The direction of the
dependency — a library file importing an examples file — is the wart;
the fix is to move `filled` into a shared list-lemma module, which is a
rename and is backlog, not proof content.

**P6/D-m — static length, no `mop_array_length` (design D6-P6-4).** The
abstract type is `List ℕ`, which knows its length; the *concrete* length
must nevertheless be readable by the loop guard, so `hnr_mop_array_fill`
takes a cell holding `xs.length` in its precondition rather than an op
that computes it. This is the source's own discipline (`IICF_Array.thy`
has no `array_length`: `op_list_length` is refined by a *pure* rule off
the length being statically known) and it is what "capacity fixed at
init" means on a no-alloc substrate. Fallback: `Com` has no length
instruction at all, so an op is not merely undesirable but unavailable.

**P6/D-n — the op zeroes its own index cell, so its precondition takes
`junkCell` and not a cell that already holds `0`.** The synthesized
program is `i := 0; while i < n do {A[i] := v; i := i + 1}`, i.e. the
abstract program is `mopConstN 0 >>= fun z => irWhileIT … (z, xs)`, not
the bare loop. Without the prefix the rule would only be applicable to a
caller who happens to own a zeroed index cell, which is not an
interface. The price is one `ir.const` in `fillCost`, and the pipeline
charges it whether or not we like it.

**P6/D-o — the loop state is `(i, xs)` and the op's result is `xs`
alone; the gap is closed by `hnRefine_res_cast` (P6/D-k), not by a
projection rule.** P4/D-ec forces the array into the loop state (the loop
rule's body post is its frame, so everything the body mutates is in the
state). An interface op that returned a pair would push that
implementation detail onto every consumer.

The abstract fill loop is *run* before anything is proved about it,
through a computable twin of its own step function — `fillStep` is the
function §4's body-value lemma proves the abstract body equal to, so a
`#guard` here is a `#guard` about the abstract program. -/

The invariant is the *static length* discipline (P6/D-m): the loop's list

(P4/D-ed). -/
