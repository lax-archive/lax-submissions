# The array list, re-seated on the heap

Leaf **P4.5.A.7** of the P5.E re-seat (ledger **E38**), satellite of
`ArrayList.lean` and `ArrayListGrowSynth.lean`.

`ArrayListGrowSynth.lean` closed growth as one synthesized command and named
what still blocked end-to-end append: the array list keeps its buffer in a
**named IR array** (`arrayAssn buffer A`, i.e. `A ↦ₐ xs`), while the
allocator and the copy loop work on **heap ranges** (`p ↦ₕ xs` inside the one
reserved `heapName` array).  It proposed a bridge `arrayAssn ⟷ heapBlockAssn`.

**There is no such bridge, and there must not be one.**  The two assertions
own *different physical storage*, so a conversion is either an honest O(n)
element copy — which, invoked per push, destroys the amortized-O(1) headline
`ArrayListCash.lean` cashed — or it is unsound.  A.1 makes the second
impossible by construction: `acells` sends `heapName` to `Tsa.zero` and
`not_irSTATE_ptoArr_heapName` is the compiled fact that the heap name is not
ownable as an ordinary array.

So the representation moves instead, and no conversion ever happens.  This is
P5.E's own description of the work — *re-seating is statement strengthening
plus substrate substitution; the representation theory and the abstract
refinement layer are reused, not rewritten*.  `ArrayList` (= `BoundedArray`),
`arrayListRel`, `boundedPush`, `arlShrinkCapacity`, and **every value-level
theorem** are reused verbatim; the `*ExecState_refines` bridges of
`ArrayList.lean` are literally the ones this file cites.  What changes is the
assertion and the executable rules beneath it.

## The representation

| landed (`ArrayList.lean`) | here |
|---|---|
| `boundedArrayAssn s c = ⌜s.Wf⌝ ∗ (arrayAssn s.buffer c.1 ∗ …)` | `heapBoundedArrayAssn p s c = ⌜s.Wf⌝ ∗ (heapBlockAssnAt p s.buffer c.1 ∗ …)` |
| `arrayListAssn = hrComp boundedArrayAssn arrayListRel` | `heapArrayListAssn p = hrComp (heapBoundedArrayAssn p) arrayListRel` |

`heapBlockAssnAt p xs c = (c ↦ᵥ p) ∗ (p ↦ₕ xs)` is `HeapAlloc.lean`'s
`heapBlockAssn` with the base pointer **pinned** rather than existential.  The
pinned form is the registered one and the packed form
(`heapArrayListAssnPacked`, `heapBlockAssn`'s own shape) is deliberately not
registered — this is `HeapEO.lean`'s judgment call **D-B1d** verbatim, and the
reason is E29: a packed form in the database lets synthesis silently repack
inside a loop.  `heapArrayListAssn_entails_packed` reaches it when an
interface must hide the pointer.

The *interface* is untouched (hazard: rule 5).  `intfOfAssn (heapArrayListAssn p)
(ListI ℕ)` holds, `arrayListAssn_intf` is untouched, and the P5.A interface
layer, the `sepref_fref_thms` over `arrayListRel`, and every pure registered
rule are shared between the two representations without change: they are
stated at the *relation*, which is the same relation.

## Address arithmetic is the caller's — and it is charged

A.1's `haget_triple` / `haset_triple` take the **absolute** address `p + j` in
the index cell, so a heap read is one `ir.aget` and nothing is smuggled; the
caller that must form `p + j` emits an ordinary `binop .add` and pays its own
`ir.add`.  That is `HeapEO.lean`'s judgment call **D-B1c**, and it is the one
real cost difference between the two representations:

| op | named-array command | heap command | Δ |
|---|---|---|---|
| `length`, `isEmpty` | metadata only | *the same rule* | — |
| `get` | `aget` | `add ; aget` | `+ir.add` |
| `last` | `sub ; aget` | `sub ; add ; aget` | `+ir.add` |
| `set` | `aset ; skip ; skip` | `add ; aset ; skip ; skip` | `+ir.add` |
| `butlast` | `sub ; mul ; mul ; copy ; ite[ ; ite] ; skip ; skip` | `sub ; skip ; skip` | `−2·ir.mul −ir.ite[−ir.ite] −2·ir.copy` |
| `swap` | 2·`aget` 2·`aset` 2·`skip` | 2·`add` 2·`aget` 2·`aset` 2·`skip` | `+2·ir.add` |

Every one of those costs is read off the *emitted* program by a `#guard` in
§ 6 (ledger **F11**, whose failure class has now bitten five times), not
assigned by fiat.

## `butlast` is the one operation whose *program* the re-seat changes (ledger E39)

Every other row above adds instructions; `butlast`'s row removes them, and it
is the only row where the two representations compute a different concrete
state for the same abstract list.  The named-array `butlast` applies the
source's conditional **logical** capacity shrink (`arlShrinkCapacity`); the
heap `butlast` carries the capacity through untouched, so the emitted command
collapses to the length decrement and the two `skip`s that pack the result
triple.

That is not a liberty taken for cheapness — it is forced, and it is what
makes `butlast` composable with `append`:

* **It costs nothing physical.**  Neither version performs a single heap
  operation: both commands mention neither `heapName` nor `hpName`, which is
  compiled in § 6.  The shrink is metadata, so *occupancy is identical with or
  without it*, and the block stays at its geometric size — which E34's
  `arlAllocatedMany_live_bounded` already bounds at ≤ 4× the live set.  A.3's
  LIFO allocator could not have returned the tail in any case
  (`free_nontop_false`).  What the shrink costs is a space **constant**, which
  is explicitly a non-issue.
* **It buys the representation invariant back.**  A heap block owns exactly
  what was allocated for it, `arlTight s : s.capacity = s.buffer.length`, and
  the shrink is the one landed operation that breaks it: the tight state
  `⟨replicate 100 0, 17, 100⟩` shrinks to capacity `32` in a buffer of length
  `100`.  `ArrayListAppendSynth.lean`'s append dispatch carries `arlTight` in
  `s.Wf`'s position, so with the shrink in place *a program that does `butlast`
  then `append` could not be synthesized at all*.  Without it, `arlTight` is
  preserved, and `ArrayListButlastAppend.lean` is the composed command.

The named-array representation keeps its shrink: `ArrayList.lean` is untouched
and its seven registered rules stay the right rules for a caller who owns a
named array, whose buffer is not sized by an allocator.  The two
representations therefore compute *different concrete states* for the same
abstract list — and they agree exactly where it counts, both refining
`op_list_butlast` through the same `arrayListRel`
(`arlHButlastExecState_refines` against `arlButlastExecState_refines`).  The
abstract guarantee `arlButlastOp_refines` is untouched by either.

## Registration, and why nothing competes (ledger E29)

This is **additive**: `ArrayList.lean`'s seven registered rules are untouched
and stay the right rules for a caller who owns a named array.  So the E29
question — two registered representations of one interface — has to be
answered, and it is answered operation by operation rather than waved at.

* The heap layer introduces **its own mops**: `mopHaddr`, `mopHaget`,
  `mopHaset`, `arlH*Raw`, `arlH*ExecSpec`.  Nothing is re-registered at a
  second assertion.
* For `get`, `last`, `set` and `swap` the two abstract operations are
  genuinely different — `arlHGetExecSpec` costs an `ir.add` that
  `arlGetExecSpec` does not — so the rules are not interchangeable at all.
* For `butlast` the two abstract operations are genuinely different too, and
  in both value and price: `arlHButlastExecSpec` leaves the capacity alone and
  costs `ir.sub + 2·ir.skip`, where `arlButlastExecSpec` computes
  `arlShrinkCapacity` and costs five to six instructions more.  It is
  additionally kept a distinct `irreducible` constant, which makes the two
  keys syntactically distinct; and even without that, selection
  is "the first entry that applies **and** whose side conditions close", with
  backtracking (`Translate.lean`'s `transOp`), so a context holding one
  representation cannot be served the other rule — the frame premise fails.
* `length` and `isEmpty` are not re-registered at all: their landed rules are
  reused as proof terms (`arlHLength_exec_hnr`, `arlHIsEmpty_exec_hnr`) and
  carry no attribute.

What E29 actually warns against is synthesis silently choosing an
**allocating or repacking** form inside a loop.  None of the rules registered
here allocates, none repacks, and every one hands the block back at the same
base and the same cell.  The empirical check is the consumer package, whose
own `sepref_synth` invocations all run with these rules in the database.

## What is *not* touched, and what this does not close

`arlAppendOp_refines` is unchanged — still `@[sepref_fref_thms]` over
`arrayListRel` at precondition `fun _ : List ℕ => True`, `arrayListReadyRel`
still deleted, `ArrayListCash.lean`'s compiled `arlAppendOp_refines_unchanged`
still passing.  `dynRate` and its domination proofs are untouched **and
unaffected**: they are stated about `arlAppendMachineN`, which is assembled
from the *named-array* adapter's emitted programs, and this file adds
programs without changing any of those.  Should append later be re-seated
too, its growth branch is already heap-native (`arlGrowPushSynth_impl`) and
only the in-place branch's `+ir.add` would need cashing; that is named here
rather than pre-empted.

**Append synthesizes end to end** — in `ArrayListAppendSynth.lean` (A.8,
ledger E39), one `Com` and one `hnRefine` with both branches live.  The gap
this file's original header named was not representational but `hnr_If` over a
*moving* base pointer: the in-place branch keeps the block at `p`, the growth
branch returns a block at a fresh `p'`, so the two postconditions are
`heapBlockAssnAt p` and `heapBlockAssnAt p'` and `MERGE` cannot identify them.
It was closed the way that header predicted — the merged form is the packed
`heapBlockAssn`, which D-B1d keeps out of the database, so append's dispatch is
composed and used *by name*, never registered, in the idiom
`ArrayListGrowSynth.lean` used for `arlGrowSynth`.  The base pointer
disappears from the *result* assertion, not from `Γ`.

Three mops, three registered rules.  They are *new* operations, not the
landed `mopBinop`/`mopAget`/`mopAset` re-registered at a second assertion —
see the header's E29 paragraph.  `mopHaget`/`mopHaset` take the **absolute**
address as their abstract operand, which is what `haget_triple` /
`haset_triple` take in the index cell, and what makes the address value flow
*through* `hnr_seq`'s binder: a rule whose mop mentioned only the offset would
have to recover `a = p + ?j` from an opaque binder, which is the wall
`ArrayListGrowSynth.lean`'s header names. -/

/-- `adr := base + idx`.  The block's base cell is **read** out of the pinned
assertion — the block survives — and the caller pays one `ir.add`

/-! ## 3. The seven operations, re-seated

`length` and `isEmpty` touch only the metadata cells, so their landed rules
are representation-independent and are reused **verbatim** — the proof terms
below are `ArrayList.lean`'s own theorems, not re-derivations, and they are
deliberately not re-tagged (there is exactly one registered rule per
operation).  `butlast` still emits a command that never mentions the buffer
cell, but it is no longer the *same* command: the logical shrink is dropped, so
what is left is the length decrement and the two `skip`s that pack the result
triple, and `four`, `two`, `fourN`, `twoN`, `outCap` are gone from the rule
rather than kept as dead parameters (header, ledger **E39**).  The remaining
four — `get`, `last`, `set`, `swap` — gain the address instruction the header's
table prices. -/

`arlPred` followed by the two `mopPair`s that pack the result triple.  Neither

/-! ### `butlast`'s bridge, the one that *is* re-derived (ledger E39)

The heap `butlast` reaches a different concrete state than the named-array one
— same buffer, same length, **different capacity** — so `ArrayList.lean`'s
`arlButlastExecSpec_refines` is not available as a proof term here.  What is
reused is the part that carries the content: the two states have the same
`buffer` and the same `length`, hence *literally the same* `active`, so
`arlButlastExecState_refines` still supplies the list step and only `Wf` has to
be re-checked.  That is strictly easier than the shrinking case, whose three
`Wf` clauses each needed an `arlShrinkCapacity` case split: here all three are
inherited from `s`, because only the length goes down. -/

/-! ### Negative controls, each flipped and confirmed to bite

Every control is a *mutilation* of an emitted command above.  They are stated
as `≠` against the correct run, so each one compiles only because the mutilated
program really does produce a different answer. -/

/-- **Control 1 — no address formation.**  Read `heap[adr]` with `adr` at its
junk value `9`: a legal heap index, so the program runs to completion and
answers `96` instead of `7`.  This is the control that would be vacuous from a
zeroed scratch cell. -/
def getNoAddrProg : Com := .aget "out" heapName "adr"

#guard readVars ((evalFuel 20 getNoAddrProg gateState).getD (gateState, 0)).1 ["out"]
  ≠ readVars getOut.1 ["out"]

/-- **Control 2 — the base pointer ignored.**  Use the *offset* as the address,
i.e. read as if the block were based at `0`.  This is the one control that is
specifically about the re-seat: it answers `93`, a cell below the block. -/
def getBaseZeroProg : Com := .aget "out" heapName "idx"

#guard readVars ((evalFuel 20 getBaseZeroProg gateState).getD (gateState, 0)).1 ["out"]
  ≠ readVars getOut.1 ["out"]

/-- **Control 3 — `last` without the predecessor step.**  `idx` keeps its
input value `2`, so the read lands one slot short of the end. -/
def lastNoSubProg : Com := arlHGetCom "bc" "idx" "adr" "out"

#guard readVars ((evalFuel 20 lastNoSubProg gateState).getD (gateState, 0)).1 ["out"]
  ≠ readVars lastOut.1 ["out"]

/-- **Control 4 — `set` without address formation.**  The write lands at the
junk address `9`, outside the block: the buffer is unchanged and the junk
above it is corrupted. -/
def setNoAddrProg : Com :=
  .seq (.aset heapName "adr" "value") (.seq .skip .skip)

#guard readArrs ((evalFuel 20 setNoAddrProg gateState).getD (gateState, 0)).1 [heapName]
  ≠ readArrs setOut.1 [heapName]

/-- **Control 5 — `swap` missing the second address.**  `AJ` keeps its junk
value `9`, so the second half of the exchange happens outside the block. -/
def swapNoAJProg : Com :=
  .seq (.binop .add "AI" "bc" "I")
    (.seq (.aget "XI" heapName "AI")
      (.seq (.aget "XJ" heapName "AJ")
        (.seq (.aset heapName "AI" "XJ")
          (.seq (.aset heapName "AJ" "XI") (.seq .skip .skip)))))

#guard readArrs ((evalFuel 30 swapNoAJProg gateState).getD (gateState, 0)).1 [heapName]
  ≠ readArrs swapOut.1 [heapName]

/-- **Control 6 — `butlast` without the length decrement.**  Only the two
packing `skip`s are left, so `len` keeps its input value `17`: the program runs
to completion and answers the wrong length, and it is one `ir.sub` cheaper. -/
def butlastNoPredProg : Com := .seq .skip .skip

#guard (evalFuel 30 butlastNoPredProg butlastState).isSome
#guard readVars ((evalFuel 30 butlastNoPredProg butlastState).getD (butlastState, 0)).1 ["len"]
  ≠ readVars butlastOut.1 ["len"]
#guard costVector ((evalFuel 30 butlastNoPredProg butlastState).getD (butlastState, 0)).2
  ≠ costVector butlastOut.2

/-- **Control 7 — the shrink put back**, i.e. the landed command spliced in
where the new one belongs.  It runs to completion and hands back a capacity of
`32` for a block of `100`; that is precisely the state `arlTight` rejects, and
`ArrayListButlastAppend.lean` is where it is shown to break the append that
follows. -/
def butlastShrinkProg : Com :=
  arlButlastCom "bc" "len" "cap" "one" "four" "two" "fourN" "twoN" "outCap"

#guard (evalFuel 30 butlastShrinkProg arrButlastState).isSome
#guard readVars ((evalFuel 30 butlastShrinkProg arrButlastState).getD
    (arrButlastState, 0)).1 ["outCap"] ≠ readVars butlastOut.1 ["cap"]

/-! **Control 8 — the cost claims themselves.**  One unit off the predicted
vector fails against the run.  This is the check that ledger F11's failure
class is being tested for and not merely mentioned. -/
#guard runVec getOut.2 ≠ ⟨0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0⟩
#guard runVec butlastOut.2 ≠ (⟨0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0⟩ : IrVecN)

#guard runVec butlastOut.2 ≠ (⟨0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0⟩ : IrVecN)
