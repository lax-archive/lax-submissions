# The cursor-setup block, and growth as one synthesized command

Leaf **P4.5.A.6**, the last named gap of the P5.E re-seat (ledger **E35**).
`ArrayListGrow.lean` left growth as *two registered rules and an exact price,
but not one synthesized command*, and named what was missing: a
**cursor-setup block** — `si`/`se` from the live block's base, `di`/`dc` from
`mopAlloc`'s result cell, and the literal `1` in `one` — five straight-line
instructions at constant cost, plus the composition that threads them.  This
file lands the block, closes the chain, and drives the whole thing through
`sepref_synth`.

## The emitted command

```
pc := $hp ; $hp := $hp + nc            -- allocProg  (A.2, registered)
si := sc                               -- ┐
se := sc + lc                          -- │ the cursor-setup block:
one := 1                               -- │ five straight-line instructions,
di := pc                               -- │ constant cost, no loop
dc := pc                               -- ┘
while si < se do { t := heap[si]; heap[di] := t; si += one; di += one }
heap[di] := xc                         -- the element write (push form only)
```

`arlGrowSynth_impl` is the first seven instructions plus the loop;
`arlGrowPushSynth_impl` adds the element write, and is the growth *branch* of
`arl_append` — its value is `arlPushGrown`'s buffer, checked by execution
against the pure model in `§ GrowGate`.

## Why the setup block sits *after* the allocation, and in one rule

The obvious shape — synthesize `si := sc`, `se := sc + lc`, `one := 1` as
three separate `mopCopy` / `mopBinop` / `mopConstN` steps and then apply
`hnr_mop_blit` — **does not compose, and the failure is structural rather
than tactical.**  `hnr_seq`'s continuation premise is `∀ a, returnT a ≤ m →
hnRefine (hnCtxt Rh a x ∗ Γ₁) …`: the value a synthesized step leaves in its
destination cell is *universally quantified*, so downstream the context says
only "`one` holds something", never "`one` holds `1`".  `hnr_mop_blit`
genuinely needs `si ↦ᵥ sp`, `se ↦ᵥ sp + n` and `one ↦ᵥ 1`, and no frame
inference can recover those from an opaque binder.  That is why every landed
consumer in this tower (`rowEndSynth`, `arlButlastSynth`, `arlLastSynth`)
takes its `one` cell as a *caller-supplied* `hnCtxt natAssn 1 one` rather
than synthesizing it.

The same wall stands in front of the allocation: `mopAlloc`'s result is
`heapBlockAssn (List.replicate n 0) pc = ∃ᵃ p, (pc ↦ᵥ p) ∗ (p ↦ₕ …)`, so the
fresh block's base pointer exists only under an existential, and `di := pc`,
`dc := pc` and the loop's `dp ↦ₕ zs` all mention it.  A rule that leaves the
block's ownership *surviving* the binder cannot be composed at all — the
synthesizer says so in as many words ("there is no junk form for its
assertion — the postcondition cannot be closed over the binder").

Both are answered the same way, and it is the source's own discipline: the
block is **one rule**.  `hnr_mop_growBlock` takes the six scratch cells as
`junkCell`s, the two live values as `hnCtxt`s and the fresh block as a whole
`hnCtxt heapBlockAssn zs pc`, eliminates the existential *inside* the rule
(`hnr_pre_ex_conv`'s triple-level twin `irHtriple_sepEx'`), and hands the
block back at `dc`.  The existential never escapes and no synthesized value
is ever constrained downstream.  What remains for `sepref_synth` is exactly
two steps — allocate, then the block — and it finds both.

## The prediction check (ledger F11's failure class, fourth appearance)

`ArrayListCash.lean`'s `arlBlitSetupN = ⟨copy 3, const 1, add 1⟩` was written
from a *description* of this block, hours before the block existed.  It is
checked here, not assumed, and in two independent ways:

* `arlBlitSetupN_toE : arlBlitSetupN.toE = arlSetupCost` — the vector equals
  the price the composed triple actually pays;
* `#guard growRunVec growDemoOut.2 = arlAllocN + arlBlitSetupN + arlBlitN 3` —
  the *emitted program*, run on a concrete heap by `evalFuel`, charges
  exactly that vector.

**It matched, exactly.**  Three `ir.copy` (`si` from the live base, `di` and
`dc` from the allocator's result cell), one `ir.add` (`se ← sp + n`), one
`ir.const` (`one ← 1`), and nothing else.  So `arlAppendMachineN`'s growth
branch stands unchanged and `ArrayListCash.lean` needs no correction — unlike
`arlCopyCost` (E34) and `implHeapSwimCost`/`implHeapSinkCost` (F11), which is
worth recording precisely because the same check is what caught those.

One degree of freedom is worth naming rather than hiding: `dc` and `pc` are
kept distinct, so the block costs three copies.  A caller willing to let the
block live in the allocator's own result cell could instantiate `dc := pc`
and save one `ir.copy`.  That is *not* what a real caller wants — the block
has to land in the array list's own buffer cell, which is occupied by the old
base pointer at allocation time and so cannot be the allocator's junk
destination — and it is not what `arlBlitSetupN` predicted, so the distinct
cells are kept and the extra copy is real.

## Disjointness (hazard: it is discharged, not assumed)

`hnr_mop_blit` requires the source and destination ranges separated, and the
premise that says so is the separating conjunction itself: `(sp ↦ₕ xs) ∗
(dp ↦ₕ zs)` (`HeapCopy.lean`'s D-A4a, with `blitPre_overlap_false` compiling
the converse).  In the composed rule that conjunction is *produced*, not
required: the caller supplies `sp ↦ₕ xs` and the availability resource, the
allocator's `hnr_mop_alloc` splits `dp ↦ₕ List.replicate n 0` **out of**
`avail hp (n + k)` by `avail_split`, and the two conjuncts then sit side by
side in one assertion.  What makes that legitimate is `avail_owns_nothing_below`
and `alloc_no_reuse`: the availability resource owns nothing below its bump
pointer, so the fresh range cannot be any part of the live one.  The
top-level statement therefore carries **no** arithmetic disjointness
hypothesis for a caller to supply — the only side conditions are the two
length bounds, and they are inside the `mop`'s own `assert`
(`hnr_assert`), where the array list's `Wf` discharges them
(`arlGrowRaw_eq`, `arlGrowPushRaw_eq`).

## Registration (ledger E29)

`hnr_mop_growBlock` and `hnr_mop_growPush` **are** registered in
`sepref_fr_rules`; `arlGrowSynth` and `arlGrowPushSynth` — the composed
commands, which *do* contain an allocation — are **not**.

The registered rules are safe under E29 for the same reason `hnr_mop_blit`
is, and it is checked rather than argued: their programs are closed and
allocation-free.  `growBlock_no_hp` / `growPush_no_hp` are compiled
`#guard`s that neither block mentions `hpName` anywhere, at fresh cell names;
`allocProg_uses_hp` is the positive control that the check can fail.  So
synthesis cannot use these rules to place an allocation inside a loop: there
is no allocation in them to place.

The composed commands are a different matter, and that is exactly why they
stay out of the database.  `arlGrowSynth_impl` begins with `allocProg`, so
registering it would let the frame inferencer drop an allocation into any
loop body whose abstract program happened to mention `arlGrowRaw`.  Nothing
needs it registered: growth is reached by *naming* `arlGrowRaw` /
`arlGrowPushRaw`, exactly as `ArrayListGrow.lean` says the allocating path
should be, and the array-list family's registered executable rules stay the
seven nonallocating commands plus P4's in-place `arlAppend_exec_hnr`.

## What this does *not* close

Append is **not** synthesizable end to end, and the remaining gap is
representational rather than combinatorial.  `ArrayList.lean` represents the
buffer as a *named IR array* (`arrayAssn buffer A`, `A ↦ₐ xs`), while the
allocator and the copy loop work on *heap ranges* (`p ↦ₕ xs` inside the one
reserved `heapName` array).  There is no landed bridge `arrayAssn ⟷
heapBlockAssn`, so the growth command proved here cannot yet be plugged into
`arlAppendTotal`'s dispatch as its `else` branch: the branch test, the length
bump and the observable `(A, len, cap)` packing all live on the `arrayAssn`
side.  That bridge, and `hnr_If` over the two branches, is what a further
leaf would need; it is named here rather than softened, and nothing in this
file pretends otherwise.

`arlAppendOp_refines` is untouched — still `@[sepref_fref_thms]` over
`arrayListRel` at precondition `fun _ : List ℕ => True`, still guarded by
`ArrayListCash.lean`'s compiled `arlAppendOp_refines_unchanged`.

/-! ### E29: the registered blocks are allocation-free, mechanically

The rules put into `sepref_fr_rules` are the two blocks, not the composed
commands.  A block can only mention the cells its caller names, so the check
that matters is that neither block mentions the allocator's bump pointer
`hpName` at any instantiation — here at fresh names disjoint from it. -/

private def condMentions (x : String) : Cond → Bool
  | .eq u v => opMentions u || opMentions v
  | .lt u v => opMentions u || opMentions v
where
  opMentions : Operand → Bool
    | .cell y => y == x
    | .lit _ => false

/-- Does a command name the cell `x` anywhere? -/
private def mentions (x : String) : Com → Bool
  | .skip => false
  | .const y _ => y == x
  | .copy y z => y == x || z == x
  | .binop _ y z w => y == x || z == x || w == x
  | .aget y a i => y == x || a == x || i == x
  | .aset a i v => a == x || i == x || v == x
  | .seq c d => mentions x c || mentions x d
  | .ite b c d => condMentions x b || mentions x c || mentions x d
  | .while b c => condMentions x b || mentions x c

/-- **The E29 discharge.**  The registered cursor block never touches the bump
pointer, so no synthesis using it can place an allocation anywhere. -/
