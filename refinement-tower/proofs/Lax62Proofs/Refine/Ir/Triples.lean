The IR's credit-carrying Hoare triples, one per operation.

Port of the rule *shapes* of `thys/vcg/LLVM_Shallow_RS.thy` at the pin
recorded in `plans/word-ram/refinement-tower/design.md` §1
(`isabelle_llvm_time` @ `42dd7f5`), quoted in
`plans/word-ram/refinement-tower/p3-sl-deep-extracts.md` §5:

```isabelle
lemma ll_load_rule[vcg_rules]:
  "llvm_htriple ($$ ''load'' 1 ** ↿ll_pto x p) (ll_load p) (λr. ↑(r=x) ** ↿ll_pto x p)"
lemma ll_store_rule[vcg_rules]:
  "llvm_htriple ($$ ''store'' 1 ** ↿ll_pto xx p) (ll_store x p) (λ_. ↿ll_pto x p)"
```

and their range variants `ll_load_rule_range` / `ll_store_rule_range`,
plus the loop rule `llc_while_annot_rule` of the same file. Read
`ll_load_rule` as the extract does — "pay one `load` credit, own the
cell `p ↦ x`; get back `x`, still owning `p ↦ x`" — and every rule below
is that sentence with a name in place of an address.

Two structural facts make these one-liners rather than VCG scripts:
`Wp.lean`'s equation suite (each primitive's `wp` is `wp_consume` glued
to the op's effect) and `Assn.lean`'s four extraction lemmas
(`ptoVar_vars` / `ptoVar_setVar` / `ptoArr_arrs` / `ptoArr_setArr`) plus
`costCredits_split`. The source's proofs are `by vcg`, i.e. its solver
does the same three steps; wave C's `Ir/SepSolver.lean` is what turns
these applications into a tactic.

## Judgment calls

**D-t — the single-cell and the range rule coincide.** The source needs
two array rules (`ll_load_rule` at one `ll_pto`, `ll_load_rule_range` at
an `ll_range`) because an LLVM array is an address range whose ownership
splits index by index. Ours has one, because `a ↦ₐ xs` owns the whole
named array (judgment call D-m of `Assn.lean`) — `aget_rule` *is* the
range rule, with the source's pointer-compatibility side conditions
(`p' ~ₐ p ∧ p' -ₐ p ∈ I`) replaced by the index bound `k < xs.length`,
exactly as the extract's port notes prescribe.

**D-u — side conditions are hypotheses of the rule, not `↑!` conjuncts
of the precondition.** The source writes `↑⇩!(…)`, a pure conjunct
tagged for its auto-solver, because its rules are applied by an ML
tactic that must discharge them on the spot. Ours are applied by term
application until wave C lands the solver, so they are ordinary Lean
hypotheses; `aget_rule_pure` below records that the two shapes are one
`cons_rule` step apart, and it is the shape wave C will register.

**D-v — every rule comes in two forms.** `…_triple` is the exact triple
(`htriple`), `…_rule` the garbage-collecting one
(`irHtriple = htripleGc GC irα`, the source's `llvm_htriple`), derived
by `htriple_to_gc`. The source only ever states the second; the first is
kept because P4 composes triples, and composing exact triples does not
leak a `GC` into every intermediate assertion.

**D-w — aliasing is handled by the logic, not by side conditions.**
`copy_rule` needs no `x ≠ y` and `binop_rule` no `y ≠ z`: if the names
coincide the precondition contains `x ↦ᵥ v ∗ x ↦ᵥ w`, which is
`sepFalse` (`Assn.lean`'s `ptoVar_sepConj_self`), so the triple holds
vacuously and is simply not applicable. This is the source's discipline
for pointers, unchanged. A consumer that really wants `x := y ⊕ y` gets
it from Sepref's monadify phase, which splits duplicate arguments
(design record §3, P4 row 2).

**D-x — the loop rule is `llc_while_annot_rule`'s, with the invariant
carrying the credits.** The source's rule takes an annotated invariant
`I σ t` over an abstract loop state and a well-founded `R`, frames it
through the body, and charges one `''call''` credit per iteration
entered. Ours takes `Inv : τ → Assn` and the same well-founded `r`,
charges one `ir.while` credit per guard evaluation (judgment call D-h of
`Semantics.lean`), and requires the body to re-establish
`∃ᵃ t', ⌜r t' t⌝ ∗ ¤¤ir.while 1 ∗ Inv t'` — i.e. the invariant must hold
the credits for the iterations still to come. That *is* the ESOP'21
per-iteration discipline: `credits_add` splits one iteration's price off
the balance the invariant carries.

/-! ### The loop rule, on wave A's `countdown`

`one := 1; while 0 < n do n := n - one`, the third of wave A's gate
programs. The invariant is indexed by the value of `n`, and it *carries
the credits for the iterations still to come* — `k • (ir.while + ir.sub)`
— which is the ESOP'21 per-iteration discipline in one line: the body
spends one `ir.sub` and hands back the `ir.while` credit the *next*
guard evaluation needs, which is exactly what `while_triple`'s body
obligation asks for. -/

is visible in `wp` itself: the run needs `I κ cr`, and an empty balance
affords nothing. -/
