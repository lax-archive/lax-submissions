/-!
The P1 acceptance program: masked depth-capped breadth-first search,
specified and refined abstract-to-abstract, with the cost riding the
refinement ordering.

This is the exit criterion of P1 of the refinement-tower campaign
(`plans/word-ram/refinement-tower-plan.md`, "P1 — NREST core"): *the
masked depth-capped BFS algorithm (RamBfs's content) specified and
refined abstract-to-abstract, cost riding the ordering, in textbook
shape*. Nothing of the tower is exercised here that is not the ported
NREST core: the specification is one `NRest.spec`, the algorithm is
built from `bindT` / `consume` / `MIf` / `assert` / `whileIET`, and the
refinement proof is `gwp_specifies_I` followed by `refine_vcg` with the
loop rule reading the invariant and the energy off the term.

## What is specified

Given a graph `G` on `Fin n`, a mask `M : Fin n → Bool`, a source `s`
and a cap `d`, the algorithm computes `D : Fin n → ℕ` with

  `∀ v, ∀ k ≤ d, (D v ≤ k ↔ WD G M k s v)`,

one threshold at a time, where `WD G M k u v` is "some walk of the
masked graph from `u` to `v` has length at most `k`" and the masked
graph is `G` with an edge surviving iff **both** of its endpoints are
alive. Nothing is assumed of the source: a dead source is at distance
`0` from itself and from nothing else (`WD.of_dead`), which is what the
masked graph says too, so the single threshold-iff covers the
degenerate case without a clause of its own.

## The package constraint (design.md §10.4, adjusted)

`Lax67Proofs` depends on the `Lax67` concepts and mathlib, and on
nothing else; it cannot import the ND-MC packages, so it cannot name
`Lax3.ColoredGraphs.WithinDist` or `Lax3Proofs.RamBfs.masked`. The
vocabulary here is therefore mathlib's — `SimpleGraph (Fin n)`,
`SimpleGraph.Walk`, a `Bool` mask — and `masked`/`WD` are defined
locally with exactly the shape those two have. The bridge is one line
on the consumer's side at P7:
`Lax3Proofs.RamBfs.masked G M' = masked G (fun v => M' v ≠ 0)` and
`WD ↔ WithinDist (masked …)`, both `rfl`-adjacent, since
`deleteVerts G {v | M v = 0}` has exactly the adjacency `masked` has.
The postcondition shape is `bfs_spec`'s postcondition shape verbatim
(`∀ v k, k ≤ d → (D v ≤ k ↔ …)`), which is what makes P7 a consumer of
this file rather than a rewrite of it.

## Provenance

The abstract program is the textbook level-synchronous BFS, in the
shape of `Refine_Monadic`'s `Breadth_First_Search` example (the source
distribution's own tutorial algorithm), with the currencies of
design.md F4 attached to each step. The invariant is the classical
frontier invariant with the mask folded in, and it is the abstract
counterpart of `Lax3Proofs.RamBfs.Frontier`: written distances are
correct and final up to the current level, the frontier is the current
level, everything undiscovered reads the sentinel `d + 1`. The exit
argument is the abstract counterpart of `Frontier.complete`.

## Deviations, each flagged

* **E1 — the frontier is a `List (Fin n)` carrying a `Nodup` clause,
  and the next level is produced by a `SPEC`, not by an inner loop.**
  The source's abstract BFS chooses the next level with a set-valued
  `SPEC` and refines the order away later; ours fixes the carrier to a
  duplicate-free list already at the abstract level, because the cost
  is charged per frontier element and the honest accounting needs the
  elements to be distinct. The nondeterminism the source has — *which*
  order the level is enumerated in — is exactly what the `SPEC` still
  leaves open. Refining the `SPEC` into a `FOREACH` over the frontier
  is P2/P6 work and changes no statement here.
* **E2 — one local `progress` rule.** The loop rule's side condition
  `progress (C s)` is discharged by `progress_consume`, the `consume`
  instance of the source's `progress_bind`, which
  `BackwardsReasoning.lean` deliberately did not port ("the progress
  suite … `progress_bind` … not ported"). It is proved here in five
  lines and belongs beside `progress_consume_returnT` the next time
  that file thaws.
* **E3 — one local `wfR2` rule.** `NRest.wfR2_cost` covers a single
  currency; the energy annotation is a sum of two, so `wfR2_add` and
  `wfR2_zero` are proved locally. They belong in `TimeRefinement.lean`
  next to `wfR2_cost`.
* **E4 — the `''if''` currency is part of the advertised budget.** The
  source's `MIf` always charges `cost ''if'' 1`, and the seed of this
  algorithm branches on whether the source is alive (`RamBfs` branches
  in the same place), so the budget names that unit explicitly rather
  than hiding it inside another currency.

None of these touches a ported judgment, a rule statement or the
calculus.

## The currencies (design.md F4)

Four, all named after what the concrete program will do, and priced
later by an exchange rate at P5:

| currency | charged | total over a run |
|---|---|---|
| `bfs.init` | filling the distance array and seeding the source | `n + 1` |
| `if` | the one branch of the seed (`MIf`'s own currency) | `1` |
| `bfs.level` | one unit per level processed | at most `d` |
| `bfs.expand` | one unit per adjacency slot scanned, plus one per frontier vertex | at most `∑ v alive, (deg v + 1) ≤ 2‖E‖ + n` |

The `bfs.expand` total is the touched-only count, not `n` per level:
every vertex enters at most one frontier, so the levels partition what
is scanned (`remWeight_step`). Charging per level would be the `n²`
mistake of the ND-MC record in a new costume, and the energy
annotation is what rules it out — the budget is provable only because
the frontier weights telescope.

## The D4 gate (ledger D4)

`WD` is given a `Decidable` instance through `Reach`, its
level-by-level unfolding, *proved* equivalent (`reach_iff_WD`); so the
`#guard`s and the Plausible `#test` below check the specification's own
postcondition — `Post` — against a naive reachability decider, on the
executable twin's output. The twin is a genuine resolution of the
algorithm's nondeterminism: `nextLevelE_spec` proves that the level it
picks satisfies the `SPEC` the abstract program leaves open, so a
`#guard` about the twin is a `#guard` about a run of `bfsAlg`.

This matters for a second reason. `bfsAlg_correct` is a `⊑`, and a `⊑`
is also satisfied by a program with no results at all (`SUCCEEDT`); the
gate is what says this one has results and that they are the distances
the specification describes. A proof of non-vacuity — `nofailT` and a
witnessed `inresT` through the `whileT` fixed point — is a termination
argument the tower does not need yet and is not attempted here.

**Refutation record: none.** No authored statement in this file was
falsified — the gate ran on the drafts as written (`Post` on the four
named samples, the two Plausible properties) and found no
counterexample, and no statement had to be repaired. The three negative
controls are there to show the harness discriminates: an off-by-one
array, an all-zero array, and the *right* array read against the
*wrong* mask are all rejected by the same decision procedure that
accepts the twin's output.

The clause of `Inv` most at risk of being wrong is `settled`
(`∀ v, D v ≤ l ∨ D v = d + 1`): without it, "undiscovered" cannot be
identified with the sentinel once the cap sits below the diameter, and
`front_eq` does not propagate across an iteration. That is why the
`d = 1` sample on a graph of diameter `3` is in the gate.

/-- **P1's acceptance.** The abstract masked depth-capped BFS refines
its specification, cost included: `bfsAlg` delivers an array deciding
every masked-distance threshold up to the cap, for
`(n+1)` `bfs.init` + one `if` + `d` `bfs.level` +
`∑ v alive (deg v + 1)` `bfs.expand` units.

The proof is `gwp_specifies_I` and one `refine_vcg` run: the tactic
peels the whole program down to side conditions, and the loop rule reads
the invariant and the energy off the `whileIET` term. What is left are
the five obligations of the loop rule (twice, once per branch of the
seed's `MIf`) and the assertion, each discharged by the lemmas above. No
`gwp` rule is applied by hand. -/

/-! ## The executable gate (design record ledger D4)

`bfsAlg` is `noncomputable` (the whole NREST layer is), so the gate runs
an executable *twin*: the same algorithm with the frontier order fixed.
`nextLevelE_spec` proves that the level the twin picks is one the
abstract program's `SPEC` allows, so the twin's runs are runs of
`bfsAlg`, and the postcondition checked below is `Post` — the
specification's own statement — decided against `Reach`, the naive
level-by-level reachability decider that `reach_iff_WD` proves equal to
`WD`. That is the differential test the campaign asks for: the
specification is checked, not a paraphrase of it. -/
