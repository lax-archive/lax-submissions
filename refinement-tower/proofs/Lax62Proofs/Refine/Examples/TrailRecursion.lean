# Recursive per-arena passes over a trail array — deviation D5's exercise

`Iicf/IicfTrailArray.lean` built the touched-only array and proved its
characteristic theorem (`treset_cost_touched_only`: reset's price is a
function of the touch counter alone). `Iicf/ExercisesA.lean` §2 ran it
*straight-line* — two rounds, hand-written. Neither exercised the shape
the ND-MC C0 time bound actually stands on, and D5 asks for it: a
**driver that recurses over arenas**, running one pass per arena into a
single size-`n` scratch structure and restoring it between arenas.

That shape is where the `touched-only-costs` discipline bites. The naive
driver re-zeroes the whole scratch array per arena and pays
`n · (number of arenas)`; on ND-MC's cluster decomposition that is `n²`
and the sublinear headline is gone. The trail array charges the reset at
the number of *touched cells*, so the same driver pays
`Σ_arena |active set|` — and that sum is what the abstract algorithm
already budgets.

## The program

`clusterLoad`, smallest honest instance. The arenas are a CSR-style
block structure `off`/`mem` over the carrier `0…n-1`: arena `a` owns the
slots `off[a] … off[a+1] - 1`, and `mem[k]` is the carrier index that
slot `k` activates. The driver is

```
a := 0; acc := 0
while a < m:                       -- outer: one pass per arena
  k := off[a]; kend := off[a+1]
  while k < kend:                  -- inner: the arena's active set
    u := mem[k]
    w := A[u]                      -- tget: read what is there
    A[u] := w + 1                  -- tset: write, and push u on the trail
    acc := acc + w                 -- the *use* of the loaded array
    k := k + 1
  treset A                         -- pops exactly the writes of this arena
  a := a + 1
```

so each arena loads its active set into the shared scratch, reads it,
and hands it back clean. `acc` ends up counting, over all arenas, the
in-arena repeats — a use that genuinely reads the loaded contents, and
one whose answer is wrong if the reset does not actually clean up.

Both loops go through `sepref_synth` in one command (§4). Nothing below
writes a frame clause, a permutation, or an `Ir.Com` by hand.

## The acceptance criterion

§6. The cashed cost of the whole driver is

```
clusterCost off a j = (sizesSum off a j) • touchUnit + j • arenaConst + irUnit ir.while
```

— linear in the **total number of touches** `Σ_arena |arena|`, plus a
constant per arena, plus one. `n` does not occur: `clusterCost` does not
even take `n` as an argument, which is `treset_cost_touched_only`'s
"note what it is a function of" one level up. Read at a single currency
the statement is sharpest:
`(clusterCost off a j).toFun ir.aset = 3 * sizesSum off a j` — the array
writes are *exactly* three per touch, with no `n` and no arena count in
the formula at all.

The one `O(n)` charge the discipline allows is the initial fill, paid
once: `clusterTotalCost n off m = tinitCost n + clusterCost off 0 m`, and
`n` occurs in the first summand and nowhere else (§6.4).

The negative control (§7.3) is a proof, not an example: the naive
per-arena re-zero admits **no** bound of the touched-only shape
`c₁ · touches + c₂ · arenas + c₃`, for any constants whatsoever.

## Judgment calls (R0/D-c…)

**R0/D-c — the trail array is a component of *both* loop states, not of
the frame.** It is tempting to leave it in the outer loop's frame: it is
`(replicate n dflt, 0)` at entry to every arena and again at exit, so
the frame really is restored. But `hnr_while`'s body post *is* the loop
frame, and the body mutates the array in between — P4/D-ec's rule, which
is about the body, not about the endpoints. So the outer state is
`(a, acc, trail)` at `("a", "acc", ("A", "T", "t"))` and the inner state
is `(k, acc, trail)` at `("k0", "acc", ("A", "T", "t"))`, the two sharing
the accumulator's cell and the array's three cells exactly as
`BfsQSynth`'s drain and scan loops share `"dist"`, `"q"` and `"tl"`. The
value proof then carries `s.2.2 = (List.replicate n dflt, 0)` as an
explicit hypothesis of the outer loop lemma, preserved because
`mop_treset` returns that constant — which is the mathematical content
of "the arenas do not interfere".

**R0/D-d — the write value is `w + 1`, not the literal `1`, and that is
forced.** `hnr_mop_tset` asks the caller for `hnCtxt natAssn v V` *and*
`hnCtxt natAssn 1 one` as two conjuncts. With `v = 1` those are the same
assertion, the separation logic is precise, and a precondition owning one
cell holding `1` cannot supply both. Writing the incremented value read
back a moment earlier is the natural program anyway (it is what makes
`acc` a repeat count), and its cell is distinct from `"one"` by
construction. Fallback: own two constant cells both holding `1`.

**R0/D-e — two in-place scalar ops are declared here, for P7/D-bb's
reason.** `acc := acc + w` and `k := k + 1` are components of loop states,
so the loop rule fixes their cells; `hnr_mop_binop` (junk destination) is
tried before `hnr_mop_binop_self` and does not backtrack, and at both
points a scratch cell is free. `mopSucc` (BfsQSynth's, restated here so
this file does not import the BFS package) and `mopAddIn` are the same
fix: a distinct abstract operation with exactly one rule, the in-place
one. Note the contrast with `a1 := a + 1` in the outer body, which is a
*fresh temporary* and is therefore left as a plain `mopBinop` — the
pipeline routes it to a scratch cell, which is what it should do.

**R0/D-f — the reset's two scratch cells are the inner pass's.** The
synthesized program is `resetCom "A" "T" "t" "u" "w" "D" "one"`: the
allocator reused `"u"` and `"w"`, dead by then, as the pop loop's index
and slot temporaries. Nothing asked it to; it is what the frame matcher
found. Recorded because a reader counting registers should not expect two
more.

**R0/D-g — the touch counter counts *writes*, so a repeated index inside
one arena is charged twice.** `IicfTrailArray`'s P6/D-p: the push is
unconditional. The falsification block (§2) pins this rather than
papering over it — arena 1 of the sample writes slot `4` twice and pops
three times for two distinct cells — and it is why `ArenaOk` requires
`|arena| ≤ n` rather than `|{distinct cells}| ≤ n`. It is also why
`sizesSum` (a sum of arena *widths*) is the right resource: it is an
upper bound for distinct cells and the exact write count.

for every such triple there is a carrier and an arena family that breaks
it. The family is the honest one: single-element arenas, so
`touches = arenas` and the trail driver's own count `3 · touches` is of
the shape with `c₁ = 3`. -/

/-! ## 8. Telemetry (the wave's acceptance numbers)

* **Authored lines: 415.** `wc -l` is 893; a nesting-aware scan
  classifies 113 as blank and 365 as comment (inside a block comment or a
  docstring, or a `--` line). The two pinned `sepref_synth` outputs and
  the six pinned `#print axioms` lines sit inside docstrings and are
  therefore in the comment bucket. Of the 415, the two abstract loop
  bodies and the two loop wrappers are 20 lines and the two
  `sepref_synth` invocations 12; the rest is the falsification block, the
  value lemmas and the cost algebra.

* **Hand-written frame clauses: 0.** Nothing in this file rewrites with
  `sepConj_assoc`, `sepConj_comm`, `ac_rfl` *on assertions*,
  `irSTATE_rot`, `fri`, `iicf_perm`, `hnRefine_pre_perm`,
  `hnRefine_frame` or `entails_of_eq`. The two `ac_rfl`s (in `innerF_eq`
  and `arenaF_eq`) are on **cost sums** (`ECost`, an `AddCommMonoid`),
  under a `congr 1`, not on `∗`. The `∗`-lists in the two `sepref_synth`
  goals and in `clusterPre` are interface — what the caller owns — and
  every permutation, split and frame that turns them into rule instances
  is inferred, *including the ones that reach inside the nested loop's
  state to hand the trail array to `mop_treset`*.

* **Bespoke tactics: 0.** Two `sepref_synth` invocations; the rest is
  `rw`/`simp only`/`omega`/`abel`/`decide +kernel`.

* **Interface ops consumed: 6** — `mopAget`, `mopBinop`, `mopPair` (P4
  primitives); `mop_tget`, `mop_tset`, `mop_treset`
  (`Iicf/IicfTrailArray.lean`, all three with synthesized
  implementations) — plus the two in-place scalar ops declared here
  (§1), and `mop_array_fill` through `tinitProg` in §6.4.

* **Wall clock**, warm build, `lake env lean` on the single file: **15.5
  s**, of which the two `sepref_synth` invocations and the ten
  `decide +kernel` cost pins are the bulk. The nested synthesis
  (`clusterSynth`) needed `maxHeartbeats 1000000`; the standalone inner
  loop needed none.

* **Axioms.** `#print axioms` is pinned above for `innerSynth`,
  `clusterSynth`, `clusterLoop_value`, `clusterCost_touched_only`,
  `clusterProg_value` and `clusterSynth_touched_only`: all six are
  `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]` and nothing else.

* **Backlog.** (i) `Lax13Proofs.lean` does not import this module; adding
  the line is the landing wave's, since this file was written under a
  do-not-edit-existing-files constraint. (ii) §6.4's `clusterProg` is
  costed but not synthesized end to end: `hnr_trail_init`
  (`Iicf/IicfTrailArray.lean` §8) is not a `sepref_fr_rules` entry — it
  cannot be, its precondition is junk — so composing it with
  `clusterSynth_impl` is one `hnr_seq` plus one state build, written by
  hand. Nothing about the criterion depends on it: the `O(n)` fill is the
  charge the discipline *allows*. (iii) That `acc` counts in-arena
  repeats is checked on the sample (§2), not proved; the wave's gate is
  the cost, not the driver's functional specification. -/
