# P7 wave A — the queue-based masked depth-capped search

The gate program, at the IR's own operations and combinators
(`Sepref/IrOps.lean`), with its correctness and its **linear** cost
bound proved at the `NRest` layer:

```
bfsQ n d src off tgt alv dist₀ q₀
  ≤ SPEC (dist decides masked distance at every threshold ≤ d)
         (n • fill + n • pop + ns • scan + K)
```

All data is first-order — `dist`, the queue and the CSR arrays are
`List ℕ`, the indices are `ℕ` — which is the shape wave B synthesizes.
The graph appears only in the *specification* and in the proof: the
program never mentions it.

## Judgment calls (P7/D-a …)

**P7/D-a — the direct queue invariant, not a data refinement off
`bfsAlg`.** P1's abstract BFS is level-synchronous: one iteration per
level, with the frontier as a list. The queue program's drain loop pops
*one* vertex per iteration, so an abstract iteration is a whole run of
concrete ones and the refinement would be a nested-loop simulation. The
direct route re-proves the frontier invariant in queue form (`Fr`, §4)
and is the cheaper of the two. What is reused from `Bfs.lean` is the
*graph theory*, which is where the mathematics is: `masked`, `WD` and
its five decomposition lemmas, plus the two `wfR2` gap lemmas — see the
telemetry.

**P7/D-b — three loops, three fuel inductions; the VCG's loop rule is
available but not consumed.** The three loops all have a state-bounded
iteration count (`n - i`, `kend - k`, `n - head`), so each is bounded by
an induction on that measure — and the same induction delivers the
`LOOP_VARIANT` annotation wave B needs (§7), which a `While`
application does not. The general bridge from the translator's
`irWhileIT` to the VCG's `whileIET` is proved anyway
(`Sepref/IrLoop.lean`, P7/T-a): it is a real gap in the tower, found
here, and it is what a loop *without* a state-bounded measure would need.

**P7/D-c — the relaxation test is `dist[u] = d + 1`, and `qcap` is its
price.** `RamBfs`'s test is `dist[v] + 1 < dist[u]`, which makes the
`exp` clause free and the "not already queued" step need `qcap`. Ours
makes "not already queued" free (a queued vertex reads `≤ d`) and `exp`
need `qcap`. Both invariants carry `qmono`/`qcap`; the choice is the
brief's, and it is the one a cap-`d` implementation actually writes.

**P7/D-d — `room` replaces the counting argument inside the program.**
The queue write `q[tail] := u` must be in range. `RamBfs` gets that from
a `Finset` cardinality argument over the queue's injectivity, which
mentions the graph. The clause `tail + |undiscovered live| ≤ n` says the
same thing at the *list* level, so the program's own assertion
(`popP`, `scanP`) stays graph-free — which is what lets `bfsQ` be a
program over lists and its variants be provable from its own
assertions.

**P7/D-e — every loop's assertion is guarded by that loop's
condition.** `irWhileIT` asserts before testing the guard, so an
assertion that can fail at the exit state makes the program strictly
larger than the `whileIET` the VCG knows (P7/T-a). Writing every `I` as
`bf s = true → P s` is the discipline that closes the gap, and it costs
nothing: the body is the only consumer.

**P7/D-f — the branches of the row scan are balanced with `pack3`.**
Both arms of both conditionals deliver the same triple through the same
tuple operation (P4/D-ee's rule for in-place merges), so the three paths
differ only by the two `aset`s and the one `add` the relaxing path
spends, and `scanC` is the maximum. The projection that drops the scan
index at the end of the row (`pack3 r.1 r.2.1 r.2.2.1`) is free here;
wave B junks the cell, as `rvLoop_array` does (P4/D-ec).

**Fa/D-x — the target array's physical width is a number of its own
(ND-MC rebase wave F-a, 2026-07-30).** `Csr` used to carry
`tlen : tgt.length = ns` beside `last : off[n]! = ns`, pinning the
array's length at the slot count. Nothing in the search wants that: the
scan of row `v` runs over `off[v] … off[v+1] − 1`, and `Csr.row_le_ns`
bounds that by `off[n]! = ns`, so no read of the program ever reaches a
slot at or above `ns`. The pin was inherited from `RamBfs.CsrGraph`,
where the array is *built* at exactly its slot count; the ND-MC cover
pass materializes it at a caller-chosen width `W ≥ ns` and so could not
present the relation at all (finding F-a of rebase wave B5 — the same
severing the consumer package did for the reasoning kit's relation in
`Lax3Proofs/CsrWide.lean`, at the same rationale).

The field is therefore weakened to `tlen : ns ≤ tgt.length`, which
`shape` and `last` already imply — it is kept as a field so that the
relation still reads its width discipline off its own statement, and so
that the four-field anonymous constructor every caller writes keeps its
arity. Consequences, in full:

* Every export over `Csr` — `bfsQ_correct`, `drainLoop_le'`,
  `BfsQSynth.bfsQS_correct`, `bfsQ_spec_at`, `bfsQ_spec`,
  `bfsQS_reached`, and `BfsQTrail`'s `drainLoop_touched`,
  `searchQ_touched`, `turnQ_touched`, `turnQ_bounded`, `turnsQ_touched`
  — is **statement-identical** and strictly more general: `Csr` is a
  hypothesis of each, and it got weaker. No primed form is needed, and
  the pinned callers reach the relation through `Csr.of_tlen_eq` (or
  through the four-field constructor, unchanged).
* Three internal bounds helpers change statement, because they were the
  only places the old field was consumed: `BfsQSynth.off_mem_le` now
  reads offsets against `off[n]!` rather than `tgt.length` (strictly
  stronger, and width-free), and `bfsQ_stateBound` / `bfsQ_bpre` take
  `off[n]! ≤ ns` where they took `tgt.length ≤ ns`. All three are
  `Shape`-level lemmas with no consumer outside `BfsQSynth.lean`.
* `Csr.widen` is the constructive half: the relation survives appending
  any padding whose entries are vertices.

**What the widening does *not* cover.** `Shape`'s range clause is still
`∀ j < tgt.length, tgt[j]! < n` — over the *whole* array, not the
occupied prefix — because it is consumed at full width by
`bfsQ_stateBound` (the machine's `Ir.StateBound` is state-global: every
entry of every array in the store must be a word) and by four ND-MC
passes over the same relation (`ElimSynth`'s degree pass, `ElimSynth6`'s
fill, `ExpandSynth`, `BlockLeaves`). So a widened caller must pad with
in-range values — `Csr.widen` is stated at exactly that. That is no
extra burden at the machine layer — the store bound demands `< B` of
the padding anyway — but it is a real difference from `CsrWide`'s
`∀ p < ns, tgt p < V`, and it is the residual of finding F-a.

/-! ## 2. The program

Every operation is a `mop` of `Sepref/IrOps.lean`, every branch an
`irIf`, every loop an `irWhileIT` — the shape `sepref_synth` translates,
at the IR's own currencies (P7/D-a).

The three loops assert what their operations need, and nothing else
(P4/D-ed). Each assertion is *guarded by the loop's own condition*,
which is what `irWhileIT_eq_whileIET` asks for and what makes the
assertion vacuous at the exit state. `Shape` collects the static facts
about the arrays; the rest is state.

`room` is the clause that makes the queue write in range without a
counting argument inside the program: the queue and the still
undiscovered live vertices together fit in `n`, so as long as one
undiscovered live vertex is left there is a slot for it. -/

`masked`, `WD` and its five decomposition lemmas — so what is left here
is the *queue* discipline, which the level-based program of P1 does not
have. Every clause below is here because a step asks for it; `qmono`
and `qcap` are the two a textbook leaves implicit, and they are what
makes the relaxation test `dist[u] = d + 1` sound (`RamBfs.lean` states
the same two, for the same reason). -/

`ns` counts the slots the structure occupies; `tgt.length` is the
array the caller materialized. The search reads only slots below
`off[n]! = ns`, so every read the pinned relation justified the
decoupled one justifies too — `row_le_ns` is the whole of that
argument, `of_tlen_eq` is the pinned relation as an instance, and
`widen` is the caller's side of it. -/

its neighbour `w` one more than its own distance; `w` still reads the

The one loop whose iteration count is not a state measure: it runs once
per *popped* vertex, and its price is paid out of a two-currency energy
— one `popC` per vertex still to pop, one `scanC` per adjacency slot
still to scan (`Csr.rowSum_le` is why the second is bounded by `ns`). -/

the head advances by one, the queue's expanded prefix is untouched, and
the price is one `popC` plus one `scanC` per slot of the row. -/

the body's *value*, which the body bounds pin: a one-result upper bound

/-! ## 8. The reached list (R2D/D-c)

`bfsQ_correct` specifies the *distance array* and says nothing about
the queue. A consumer that wants to scan the vertices the search
actually reached — rather than test `D[z] ≤ d` at all `n` of them —
needs one more clause: the first `max tl 1` slots of the queue list
exactly the vertices the search put within the cap, each once.

It is `Fr` at drain exit, read three times over, plus one graph fact:
a masked walk ends at a *live* vertex unless it is trivial. The
`max tl 1` is the dead-source case: the seed writes `q[0] := src`
before the drain starts, the drain never runs, and the single slot is
right. -/

/-! ## 9. Telemetry (the plan's P7 gate numbers, wave A's share)

* **Raw `wc -l`: 1,435** for this file — the counting rule of the P7
  design note, comments included. A nesting-aware scan classifies 108
  lines as blank and 312 as comment, leaving **1,015 lines of Lean**.
  The gate is 400 for the whole of P7 against `RamBfs.lean`'s 1,201, so
  **wave A alone misses it**, and by a factor of about three; P8 records
  the verdict with the breakdown below.

* **Where the lines go** (Lean lines per section, measured):
  §1 the twin and the demo, 39; §2 the program — three bodies, three
  loops, two tuple operations, four assertions and `bfsQ` — 67;
  §3 the cost constants, the three body bounds and the two counted
  loops' fuel inductions, 188; §4 the queue invariant with `relax`,
  `complete`, `pop`, `popSkip`, `seed`, the scan invariant and the
  tiling, **340**; §5 the drain, 162; §6 the export, 82; §7 the three
  variants, 121; §8 axioms, 8. The queue invariant is a third of the
  file and it is the part a *tower* cannot shrink: it is the fourteen
  clauses `RamBfs.Frontier` carries, for the same reasons.

* **What was reused from `Refine/Examples/Bfs.lean`** (P1's acceptance
  artifact, 1,051 lines, reported separately per the design note):
  `masked` and `masked_adj`; `WD` with `WD.refl`, `WD.mono`, `WD.step`,
  `WD.eq_of_zero` and `WD.tail` — the whole graph-theoretic core of the
  exit argument; and `wfR2_zero`/`wfR2_add`/`progress_consume` were
  *not* needed, because P7/D-b's route does not go through the VCG's
  loop rule. Nothing else. The level-based `Inv`, `NextLevel`,
  `inv_step` and the potential argument were **not** reusable: they are
  about a frontier list, not a queue (P7/D-a).

* **What was added to the tower** (`Sepref/IrLoop.lean`, 188 raw / 100
  Lean lines, excluded from the count as library):
  `irWhileIT_eq_whileIET` (P7/T-a, the translator-to-VCG bridge),
  `bindT_consume_right`, `bindT_unitT`, `cost_le_add`,
  `consume_returnT_le_spec`, `consume_spec`, `spec_mono`,
  `bindT_spec_le`, and the two-currency energy algebra `E2`/`E2_sub`/
  `E2_mono`/`E2_split`/`liftACost_nsmul`/`wfR2_nsmul` (P7/T-b). All are
  program-independent; `E2_sub`, `E2_mono` and `wfR2_nsmul` are what a
  `While`-rule route would consume and are unused here.

* **Hand-written frame clauses: 0.** No separation-logic connective
  appears in this file at all — wave A is entirely at the `NRest` layer.
  The `ac_rfl`s are on **cost sums** (`ECost`, an `AddCommMonoid`),
  never on `∗`.

* **Axioms.** `#print axioms` is pinned in §8 for `bfsQ_correct` and the
  three variants: `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]` and nothing
  else.

* **Refuted before proved.** §1 runs a computable twin of the very step
  functions §3 proves the abstract bodies equal to, on `RamBfs`'s own
  five-vertex arena, against the baseline's four published readings, and
  against P1's independent level-based twin on four more; one negative
  control is pinned as an error. Nothing was refuted — but three
  assumptions were corrected *before* any proof, by the shape of the
  program rather than by a failed guard: the relaxation test needs
  `qcap` (P7/D-c), the queue write needs `room` (P7/D-d), and the
  assertion must be guard-shaped or the VCG cannot see the loop
  (P7/D-e).

* **Backlog for wave B.** (i) The `else` arms of the row scan write no
  array, so the tool's `MERGE` sees `hnCtxt`-for-`hnCtxt` on the state
  but nothing to reconcile for `dist`/`q`; if that stalls, the arms need
  a write-back `aset`, which is a cost-only change here. (ii) The
  projection at the end of a row drops the scan index; wave B junks the
  cell (`hnRefine_cons_res`, P4/D-ec). (iii) `bfsQ`'s two scratch arrays
  are parameters, so the export's precondition is `bfs_spec`'s
  `∃ g, arrs "dist" = arrOf n g` verbatim. -/
