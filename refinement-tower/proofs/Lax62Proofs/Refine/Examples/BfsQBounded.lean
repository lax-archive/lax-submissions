# The spike's measurement: the BFS fill loop's bounds pass, re-derived

`Sepref/Examples/WordAssnSpike.lean` builds the two candidate layers for
the P8 verdict's option (b): `wordAssn` (§1–§3 there) and `BRefine`
(§4 there). This file is the *measurement* — the same obligation
`Examples/BfsQSynth.lean` §12 discharges, on the largest engine fragment
the spike budget reached, done the new way and counted.

## What is measured, and against what

The baseline is `BfsQSynth.lean` §12's bounds pass. Its **fill-loop
share** is:

| baseline declaration | raw lines |
|---|---|
| `eval_lt_cells` (guard inversion, shared with the drain) | 8 |
| `FInv` | 6 |
| `FInv.setVar` | 11 |
| `FInv.setArr` | 17 |
| `fill_body_bpre` | 24 |
| **total** | **66** |

plus the loop's share of `bfsQ_bpre`'s assembly (the `refine ⟨FInv …⟩`
block and the invariant at the initial store, 15 raw lines) — call it
**81 raw lines** for the fill loop alone, out of the 560 the verdict
priced.

§2 below is the same obligation through `BRefine`. It is *not* an
apples-to-apples full re-derivation of the BFS engine: the drain and row
scan are not attempted (R2/D-f records why), so the number is a
fragment-level ratio, not a program-level one.

## R2/D-f — why the measurement stops at the fill loop

The three-loop engine needs three things this spike does not have:

1. a `BRefine` analogue of `hnr_If` that knows *which* branch it is in
   (the row scan's `dist[u] = sent` test gates the queue store), so that
   the two arms can have different postconditions merged by `MERGE`;
2. `prodAssn` splitting in `BRefine`, since the drain's loop state is a
   four-component tuple and the ops want its components separately —
   `Sepref/Frame.lean`'s `conjunctsSplit` does this for the synthesis
   layer and has no `BRefine` counterpart;
3. tool integration: `BRefine` is assembled by hand here, whereas the
   synthesis layer's `sepref` driver picks and permutes rules
   automatically. Every `BRefine.perm (by ac_rfl)` below is a line the
   driver would emit.

None is deep; all three are P2 rule-layer work, and (3) is where the
remaining ratio lives. The fragment measured is the one that needs none
of them.

`BfsQSynth.fillSynth_impl` is

**(a) Authored lines on the bounds class.**

| this file, §1 | raw | `BfsQSynth.lean` §12, fill share | raw |
|---|---|---|---|
| `fillΓ` | 3 | `eval_lt_cells` | 8 |
| `fillI` | 1 | `FInv` | 5 |
| `fill_guard` | 14 | `FInv.setVar` | 10 |
| `fill_body_brefine` | 28 | `FInv.setArr` | 16 |
| `fill_brefine` | 8 | `fill_body_bpre` | 23 |
| | | fill's share of `bfsQ_bpre` | 13 |
| **total** | **54** | **total** | **75** |

**28 % as authored today.** The composition matters more than the
ratio:

* of the new 54, **14 are the guard bridge** — one lemma per guard
  *shape* (`Cond.lt` of two cells), not per loop and not per program, so
  the engine's three loops share it;
* another **14 are `BRefine.perm`/`BRefine.frame` bookkeeping** — the
  rule-application permutations `Sepref/Translate.lean`'s driver already
  computes for the synthesis half, and which a `sepref_brefine_rules`
  database would emit instead of the author;
* the per-loop marginal is therefore **≈ 26 lines**, against a baseline
  per-loop marginal of **≈ 67** (only `eval_lt_cells` amortizes there).

So the honest projection for the engine is **a 55–62 % cut of the
560-line class, to 210–250 lines**, and the part that survives is the
part that is real: the abstract invariant and one arithmetic goal per
creation site.

What is *gone*, structurally: the `Ir.State` predicate (`FInv`/`DInv`),
its `setVar`/`setArr` closure lemmas, and every `Option.some.inj` /
`simpa using` identification between a cell and the value it holds. The
assertion already says that, which is R2/D-b.

**(b) Side-condition traffic.** **Two** arithmetic goals in the whole
fragment: `Imp.Bop.apply .add i 1 < B` at the bump (the creation site)
and `i + 1 ≤ n` at the invariant restoration. Discharge mode:
`rw [Imp.Bop.apply_add]; omega` for both — **zero manual**. Notably the
`omega`-through-`Ir.Val` trap (`BfsQSynth.lean` §12's header) does *not*
fire: the operands are `ℕ`-typed abstract values, not `Ir.Val` clause
binders. Everything else — the `aset`, the guard evaluation, the `skip`,
every in-range index — is free, exactly as P7/D-bl's table predicts.

**(c) Synthesis wall-clock: unchanged, by construction.** `BRefine` is a
second component proved *after* synthesis; this file consumes
`BfsQSynth.fillSynth_impl` byte-identical, so the baseline's 49 s stands.
The added elaboration cost is the two new files: ≈ 6 s for the rule layer
(`WordAssnSpike.lean`, 900 lines including its own gate) and ≈ 6 s here.
The `wordAssn` route's synthesis time **cannot be measured**: R2/D-c
says it does not reach a two-operation program.

**(d) Rule-layer gaps.** R2/D-f above (branch-aware `ite`, `prodAssn`
splitting, tool integration), plus: no `BRefine` rule for `mopPair`/the
`pack` shapes, no `BRefine` counterpart of `MERGE`, and no
`sepref_brefine_rules` database — every rule here is applied by name.
