P3's acceptance: hand-proved credit-carrying triples for array get, set
and fill, with every frame step discharged by the solver.

The campaign plan's P3 criterion is "hand-proved credit-carrying triples
for array get/set/fill". This file is those three, as *programs* — three
`Ir.Com` terms, not three restatements of `Triples.lean`'s rules — each
with a source-shaped triple whose credit vector is exact, and each
proved without a single hand rearrangement of a `∗`-list: the frame
inference is `Ir/SepSolver.lean`'s `fri`, applied through
`irTriple_frame` (the triple-level form of `htriple_vcg_frame_erule`,
judgment call D-ae there), and nothing in this file rewrites with
`sepConj_assoc`, `sepConj_comm`, `ac_rfl` or wave B's `irSTATE_rot`.

The three programs, in design record §6's op set:

| program | IR | price |
|---|---|---|
| get | `x := A[i]` | one `ir.aget` |
| set | `A[i] := v` | one `ir.aset` |
| fill | `while i < n do { A[i] := v; i := i + one }` | `(n+1)·ir.while + n·ir.aset + n·ir.add` |

The fill accounting is wave A's convention (judgment call D-d of
`Syntax.lean`): a loop charges one `ir.while` per *guard evaluation*, so
`n` iterations charge `n + 1` — `n` successful tests and the trailing
failed one. The body charges one `ir.aset` and one `ir.add` per
iteration. Those three lines are the `fillPayload` below, and the
loop invariant carries `k` copies of it for the `k` iterations still to
come — the ESOP'21 per-iteration discipline wave B's `cd_while`
introduced, here at a program that actually does something.

## Judgment calls

**D-ag — `n` is a cell, and the measure is the number of iterations
still to run.** Design record §6 has no `len` op (array lengths live in
the `↦ₐ` assertion), so the loop bound has to be *read from somewhere*:
it is the scalar cell `"n"`, owned by the invariant and never written.
Likewise `i := i + 1` needs its `1` in a cell (judgment call D-b of
`Syntax.lean`: binop operands are cells), so the program owns `"one"`.
The measure is `k`, the iterations remaining, with `i = n - k`; the
alternative — measuring by `i` and taking the well-founded relation to
be `InvImage (·<·) (n - ·)` — needs the same subtraction one level
further in, and `Nat.lt_wfRel.wf` is what wave B's loop example already
uses.

**D-ah — the bound `k ≤ n` rides in the invariant as a `⌜⌝`
conjunct.** `while_triple`'s body obligation is `∀ t, g t = true →
irTriple (Inv t) c …`, quantified over *every* value of the measure,
including the ones the loop can never reach. The invariant therefore has
to carry its own well-formedness, and `⌜k ≤ n⌝` is it; `irTriple_pure`
(`Ir/SepSolver.lean`) turns that conjunct back into a Lean hypothesis at
the top of the body proof, and `fri` re-establishes it at the end from
the same hypothesis through its side tactic. This is exactly the shape
the source's `↑⇩!` side conditions have — a pure conjunct of an
assertion, discharged by a solver — and wave B's D-u anticipated it.

**D-ai — the array's contents are `filled m val xs`, a prefix of
`val`s over the original.** `filled m val xs = replicate m val ++
xs.drop m` is the smallest description of "the first `m` entries have
been overwritten" that is *stable under one more write*
(`filled_set`) and that collapses to the whole array at `m = xs.length`
(`filled_all`). The alternative, `xs` iterated under `List.set`, needs a
fold to state and an induction to use.

**D-aj — the assertions are `def`s whose defining equations are
registered with `fri_prepare_simps`.** The solver matches conjuncts, so
it has to *see* the conjuncts: a named assertion is opaque to it. Rather
than spelling every precondition out at every call site, each named
assertion here contributes its own `rfl` equation to the
prepare-phase simp set, which is precisely the extension point
`Ir/Attrs.lean` documents ("a consumer that defines a bundled cost tags
its own splitting lemma here and the solver sees the parts"). The same
mechanism carries `fillPayload`'s three-way split.

**D-ak — the end-to-end run goes through the *exact* triple, not the
garbage-collecting one.** Wave B's D-v keeps both forms; `irHtriple`'s
postcondition absorbs unspent credits into `GC`, which is what a
composition wants and what a *measurement* does not — the point of the
run below is that the cost vector is exactly `(4, 3, 3)`, so the triple
that reaches `BigStep` is the one whose postcondition owns no slack.
The `GC` form is exercised separately, on the set program, so that
`irHtriple_frame` and the solver's `GC`-absorption path are covered too.

`filled m val xs` is `xs` with its first `m` entries overwritten by
`val` (judgment call D-ai). Three facts about it are all the loop needs:
its length, what one more write does to it, and what it is once every
entry has been written. -/

`val`. -/

it and the precondition written in a scrambled order. The proof is one
`ir_frame` against wave B's array rule in its pure-side-condition form
(judgment call D-ad of `Ir/SepSolver.lean`): the solver finds the three
cells the rule wants among the seven on offer, discharges the index
bound as a `⌜⌝` conjunct, and instantiates the frame with the rest. -/

/-! ### The cost, as a function of `n`

The header's claim is `(n + 1)·ir.while + n·ir.aset + n·ir.add`. Wave A's
`evalFuel` twin agrees with `BigStep` in both directions
(`bigStep_iff_exists_evalFuel`), so a Plausible check on the twin is a
check on the semantics — and these are the checks that would have caught
an off-by-one in the guard accounting. -/
