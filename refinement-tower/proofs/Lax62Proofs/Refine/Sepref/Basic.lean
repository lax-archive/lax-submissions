The Sepref refinement judgment `hnRefine` on the word-RAM IR: the port of
`thys/sepref/Sepref_Basic.thy` at the pin recorded in
`plans/word-ram/refinement-tower/design.md` §1 (`isabelle_llvm_time`
@ `42dd7f5`, full SHA `42dd7f59998d76047bb4b6bce76d8f67b53a08b6`).

Extracts: `plans/word-ram/refinement-tower/source-extracts.md` §4 (the
`hn_refine` definition), `p4-sepref-extracts.md` §1, and above all
`p4-sepref-deep-extracts.md` §§1–3, which is this file's specification.
Where an extract was ambiguous the fetched `Sepref_Basic.thy` was the
authority (in particular for `hnr_bind`'s cost threading, source
~l. 629–735, and for `hn_refine_cons_complete`, ~l. 380).

## Supervisor decisions (P4/D-a … P4/D-g, owner-fixed, quoted)

**P4/D-a — concrete values are destination descriptors; the judgment is
generic in them.** The source's `hn_refine Γ c Γ' R m` has
`R : 'a ⇒ 'c ⇒ assn` with `'c` the concrete result type. Our IR is a
statement language: results are read from named cells, and the
destination is statically known (three-address code). So the port keeps
the source's `'c` as a type parameter `κ` and passes the statically-known
destination `d : κ` explicitly. `design.md` §5's `∃ᵃ r, x ↦ᵥ r ∗ R ra r`
draft is superseded: that shape is the scalar instance, recovered by
P4/D-b. Base instances defined here: `natAssn`, `arrayAssn`.

**P4/D-b — `pure`, `is_pure`, `the_pure` are ported verbatim and
generically** (`pureAssn (R : Set (κ × α)) : α → κ → Assn := fun a c =>
⌜(c, a) ∈ R⌝` — named `pureAssn` because `pure` collides with core Lean;
name-only deviation). At `κ := Ir.Val` this is the source's `pure`
exactly; whether translate consumes it for literals is wave C's affair.
`hnVal R := hnCtxt (pureAssn R)`.

**P4/D-c — `invalid_assn` splits in two.** The source's
`invalid_assn R x y ≡ ↑(pure_part (R x y))` is an ownership-free marker;
the heap substrate separately FREES the memory via `MK_FREE` programs.
Our substrate has no dealloc: a cell owned at the start of a run is owned
at its end (assertions describe the state exactly; `GC` absorbs credits
only, never cells). So:
* `invalidAssn R a c := ⌜purePart (R a c)⌝` — verbatim port, the pure
  bookkeeping marker; used where the source uses it for *structure
  alignment* (pass rule, merge bookkeeping of pure values).
* `deadAssn R a c := ∃ᵃ a', R a' c` — ours (flagged): junk-of-the-same-shape,
  the ownership sink for dead temporaries. `R a c ⊢ deadAssn R a c`
  (`entails_dead`, the invalidation weakening). `invalidate_clone` (the
  source's ownership-duplication trick) is FALSE for ownership-carrying
  `R` here and is NOT ported; proved instead:
  `hnCtxt R a c ⊢ hnCtxt (deadAssn R) a c`.

**P4/D-d — `MK_FREE` degenerates to entailment; the bind rule is the
manual-free shape.** Free programs would execute IR ops and cost
currencies the abstract side never paid. The port of `hnr_bind` is the
source's own `hnr_bind_manual_free`, with `doM`-sequencing replaced by
`Com.seq` (`hnr_seq` below). Its proof threads the two cost payments
through `wp_seq` exactly as the source's `hnr_bind` proof threads
`minus_ecost_cost`. D2's guard is kept in the source's form
`NRest.returnT a ≤ m`; `returnT_le_rest_iff` below records that at
`m = rest M` this is exactly `M a ≠ ⊥`, i.e. `∃ t, M a = some t`, so no
vocabulary delta was needed.

**P4/D-e — the MERGE calculus is entailment-form.** `MERGE`/`MERGE1`/
`MERGE_STAR`/`MERGE_triv`/`MERGE_END`/`MERGE1_eq`/`MERGE1_invalids`
(deep-extracts §3) with the free-program arguments dropped:
`MERGE Γ₁ Γ₂ Γ' := (Γ₁ ⊢ Γ') ∧ (Γ₂ ⊢ Γ')`,
`MERGE1 R1 R2 R' := ∀ a c, MERGE (R1 a c) (R2 a c) (R' a c)`,
`MERGE_STAR` congruence over `hnCtxt`-tagged conjuncts,
`MERGE1_invalids` stated with `deadAssn` (both directions). Source names
kept, camelCased where needed. These are wave C's merge-tactic rule base;
no tactic consumes them yet.

**P4/D-f — the pass rule pays for `skip`.** The source's
`hnr_RETURN_pass` uses the zero-cost monad `return`; our only do-nothing
program is `Com.skip`, which charges `¤¤Currency.skip 1` (P3 ledger D-c).
Ported as `hnr_return_pass`, plus the pure-return analogue `hnr_const`
and `hnr_assert` per the source's `hnr_ASSERT`.

**P4/D-g — GC stays P3's credits-only GC.** Dead cells are handled by
`deadAssn` conjuncts (P4/D-c), never by GC.

## This file's own judgment calls

**P4/D-h — assertion disjunction is new here, and is called `sepOr`.**
`Assn.lean` has `sepTrue`/`sepFalse` but no disjunction, so the source's
`Γ' or Γ''` (used only by `hn_refine_split_post`/`hn_refine_post_other`)
is defined here as `sepOr P Q := fun h => P h ∨ Q h`, notation `∨ᵃ`.
*Not* named `sepDisj`: that name is taken by `Ir`'s separation-disjointness
class `SepDisj`, and the two would read as variants of one another.
Rationale: a three-line definition local to its two consumers beats
touching the frozen `Assn.lean`. Fallback if wave C wants it in the
substrate: move the definition down and delete it here; nothing else
depends on its location.

**P4/D-i — `the_pure` is ported as `purePart`-collection, not as HOL's
`THE`.** The source's `the_pure P ≡ THE P'. ∀x x'. P x x' = ↑((x',x)∈P')`
is a definite description; a Lean port would need `Classical.choose` plus
an injectivity lemma to say anything at all. Instead
`thePure P := {p | purePart (P p.2 p.1)}` — total, choice-free, and
*equal* to the source's value wherever the source's is defined:
`thePure_pureAssn : thePure (pureAssn R) = R` and
`pureAssn_thePure : isPure R → pureAssn (thePure R) = R` are both proved
below, which is the entire contract the source's `the_pure` lemmas state
(`the_pure_pure`, `pure_the_pure`). Fallback: none needed — the two
lemmas pin the value on the whole `isPure` domain, and off that domain
the source's `THE` is junk too.

**P4/D-j — `hnRefineI_spect` is stated at `(returnT x).consume t`.** P1's
`NRest` has no `SPECT [x ↦ t]` singleton constructor; the source's
`SPECT [x↦t]` is `consume (RETURNT x) t` (its own `consume_RETURNT`), so
that is the shape used. Vocabulary delta only.

**P4/D-k — `hnRefine_augment_res` takes the unfolded premise.** The
source's `g ≤ₙ SPEC Φ t` needs the `le_or_fail` order, which P1 did not
port (and porting a `leof` theory for one lemma is not worth it). The
premise is stated as its unfolded content:
`∀ M, g = .rest M → ∀ a t, M a = (t : WithBot ECost) → Φ a`. Fallback: if
P5 ports `≤ₙ`, restate and derive this form.

**P4/D-l — `rdomp` quantifies over `AState`, not over "heaps".** The
source's `rdomp R a ≡ ∃h c. R a c h` reads `h` in the LLVM assertion
carrier; ours is `AState` (`Assn = AState → Prop`), i.e. `purePart` of
`∃ᵃ c, R a c`. Recorded as `rdomp_iff_purePart`.

## Deliberate absences

* `hnr_RECT` — ledger D6, out of translate scope. Not ported.
* `ht_from_hnr` — P5's cashing seam. Deferred, quoted in the extract.
* `imp_correctI` — `oops`'d in the source; nothing to port.
* `invalidate_clone` / `invalidate_clone'` — FALSE here (P4/D-c).
* `MK_FREE` and its four `mk_free_*` lemmas — degenerate to entailments
  under P4/D-d; the merge calculus of §5 is what survives of them.

Entailment-form, with the source's free-program arguments dropped. Wave C's

Every rule above was first instantiated at the concrete programs below and
its statement checked against the IR's cost ledger; the two negative
controls are the checks that failed by design. -/

/-- The ledger fact the wrong-currency control turns into a refutation. -/
example : Currency.const ≠ Currency.skip := by decide

/-- Positive control: the pass rule at a concrete cell. -/

/-- Positive control: `hnr_seq` composes two `const`s, threading the frame
through `hnRefine_frame'` / `hnRefine_frame''` and dropping the first
result's ownership to junk through `hnRefine_cons_res`. -/
