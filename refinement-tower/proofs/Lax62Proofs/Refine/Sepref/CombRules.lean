The derived control-flow rules: `hnr_If` and the loop rule.

**Provenance: these two are OURS, derived.** The cost-carrying artifact
(`isabelle_llvm_time` @ `42dd7f5`, the pin of `Basic.lean`'s header) has
**no** `If`/`While` `hn_refine` rule under any name — a repo-wide grep of
its `thys/sepref/*.thy` found none, and its examples route control flow
through `hn_RECT'` instead (design record §3, P4 row, "Source gap found
by the P2–P4 deep read"; `p4-sepref-extracts.md`, Gaps). The *shapes* are
therefore taken from the no-cost AFP twin `Refine_Imperative_HOL`
(`Sepref_Basic.thy`'s `hnr_If`, `Sepref_Translate.thy`'s
`hn_monadic_WHILE_lin`, both quoted in `p4-sepref-extracts.md` §2) and
the cost-carrying versions are *derived* from wave A's `hnRefine`,
`hnr_seq` and the MERGE calculus. Each premise below carries its
correspondence: **AFP premise ↦ our premise ↦ delta**.

## Judgment calls (continuing `IrOps.lean`'s P4/D-aa … P4/D-ae)

**P4/D-af — the guard is a *fused* judgment `CondRefine`, not an
`hn_refine` at `pure bool_rel`.** The AFP rules synthesize the guard as a
*program*: `hnr_If`'s `P ⟹⇩t Γ1 * hn_val bool_rel a a'` says the boolean
lives in a concrete location `a'`, and `hn_monadic_WHILE_lin`'s `b_ref`
premise is a whole `hn_refine … (b s) … (pure bool_rel) (b' s')`
synthesizing a bool-valued program. Our IR has **no boolean cell and no
boolean-valued op** (design record §6: conditions are structural
`Ir.Cond` over cells and literals, evaluated *inside* the `ite`/`while`
op's own charge). So the guard premise is
`CondRefine Γ cond b : ∀ F s cr, irSTATE (Γ ∗ F) (s, cr) → cond.eval s = some b`
— "under the ownership `Γ`, the structural condition evaluates to the
abstract program's branch value". This is substrate-forced, and it is
*cheaper* than the source's, not weaker: there is no separate program to
synthesize, no `Γb` to frame back (`b_fr` disappears), and no cost, since
the IR pays for guard evaluation inside `ir.ite` / `ir.while`. `Γ` here
is the *whole* precondition, which is why `CondRefine` needs
`CondRefine.frame` rather than a weakening: our separation logic is
precise (`A ∗ B ⊬ A`), so a condition rule is extended to a larger
context by *framing*, never by dropping conjuncts.

**P4/D-ag — `hnr_If`'s join is wave A's entailment-form MERGE.** The AFP
rule's `Γ2b ∨⇩A Γ2c ⟹⇩t Γ'` is a disjunction-entailment discharged by
`Sepref_Frame.thy`'s `merge_tac`; wave A ported that calculus as
`MERGE Γ₁ Γ₂ Γ' := (Γ₁ ⊢ Γ') ∧ (Γ₂ ⊢ Γ')` (P4/D-e), which is exactly
`Γ₁ ∨⇩A Γ₂ ⊢ Γ'` unfolded. So `MRG : MERGE Γt Γe Γ'` *is* the source's
`IMP`, and `MERGE1_invalids_left/right` at `deadAssn` are what let the
branches disagree about a live temporary.

**P4/D-ah — the loop's state lives in fixed cells, so the post is `Γ`.**
The AFP loop rule ends at `Γ * hn_invalid Rs s' s`: the loop's abstract
result is a *fresh value* whose concrete twin invalidates the entry
state's ownership. Ours cannot: the loop state occupies the *same* cells
`d` across every iteration (three-address code, no SSA), so the result is
delivered where every `hnRefine` delivers a result — in the judgment's
own result slot `R ra d` — and what remains of the post is the loop frame
`Γ`. The premise roles are otherwise the AFP rule's one for one; the
`INDEP Rs` and `TERM (monadic_WHILEIT, ''cond''/''body'')` premises are
tactic bookkeeping (they name which frame side condition failed, for
debugging) and are omitted, per the AFP rule's own comment — they are
wave C's business, not the logic's.

**P4/D-ai — the loop rule is *measured*, and that is the landed form.**
**(CLOSED by R0/D-b, §4b — the named blocker is refuted, not filled: the
unfueled rule `hnr_while` is the database entry now, and the measured
rule below is deregistered capital. The entry is kept verbatim because
its blocker analysis is exactly what R0/D-b corrects.)**
`hnr_while_measured` takes a variant `V : σ → ℕ` that decreases on every
state the body can produce. The unfueled general rule — where termination
comes from the abstract loop's own `nofailT` — is **backlog**, and the
blocker is precise: `RECT` is P1's `gfp` (`Rec.lean`), so an abstract
loop that diverges *is* `FAILT` and `nofailT` really does carry the
termination information, but turning it into an induction needs a P1
lemma that does not exist —
`nofailT (RECT B s) → ∃ n, fuelIter B n s = RECT B s`, or an
accessibility predicate for the body. `Rec.lean` has only
`RECT_le_fuelIter` and `RECT_eq_of_fuelIter_stable`, neither of which
gives it. The measured rule suffices for every loop the acceptance
programs contain (all have counter variants), and the general rule is a
strictly weaker premise on the same conclusion, so nothing proved with
the measured rule has to change when it lands. Note what the measured
rule does *not* need: no `INV` premise. The invariant is read off the
abstract program's non-failure (`irWhileIT` asserts `I s`, P4/D-ad), so
`I s` is available in the induction step for free and a state where the
invariant fails makes the abstract side `fail`, hence the judgment
vacuous — pinned in the gate.

**P4/D-aj — the two arithmetic helpers are named.** `afford_pay` /
`minus_pay` (and their zero-`Ca` forms) are the whole cost content of
both rules: paying an op's price out of a balance the abstract side just
topped up. They are `Wp.lean`'s `leCostECost_cash_add` /
`minusECost_cash_add` with one `add_left_comm`, isolated so that neither
rule's proof does arithmetic inline.

/-! ## 4. The loop rule (P4/D-ah, P4/D-ai)

Clause by clause against the AFP rule
(`Refine_Imperative_HOL/Sepref_Translate.thy`'s `hn_monadic_WHILE_lin`,
`p4-sepref-extracts.md` §2):

| AFP premise | ours | delta |
|---|---|---|
| `INDEP Rs` | — | tactic bookkeeping (P4/D-ah) |
| `FR : P ⟹⇩t Γ * hn_ctxt Rs s' s` | — | our conclusion is *stated* at `hnCtxt Rs s₀ d ∗ Γ`; the entry weakening is `hnRefine_cons_pre`, which the caller applies |
| `b_ref : I s' ⟹ hn_refine (Γ * hn_ctxt Rs s' s) (b s) (Γb s' s) (pure bool_rel) (b' s')` | `COND : ∀ s, I s → CondRefine (hnCtxt Rs s d ∗ Γ) cond (bf s)` | P4/D-af: the guard is structural, so the whole synthesized bool program collapses to a fact |
| `b_fr : … Γb s' s ⟹⇩t Γ * hn_ctxt Rs s' s` | — | nothing to frame back: `CondRefine` consumes nothing |
| `f_ref : I s' ⟹ hn_refine (Γ * hn_ctxt Rs s' s) (f s) (Γf s' s) Rs (f' s')` | `BODY : ∀ s, I s → bf s = true → hnRefine (hnCtxt Rs s d ∗ Γ) cbody Γ d Rs (f s)` | the body judgment. Two deltas: the post is `Γ` (P4/D-ah — the body's *result* is the new loop state, delivered in the result slot at the same cells `d`), and the guard hypothesis `bf s = true` is added, because the body only runs then (the AFP rule gets this from `b_ref`'s synthesized program) |
| `f_fr : … Γf s' s ⟹⇩t Γ * hn_ctxt (λ_ _. true) s' s` | — | subsumed: `BODY`'s post *is* `Γ` |
| — | `VAR : ∀ s s', I s → bf s = true → returnT s' ≤ f s → V s' < V s` | **added** (P4/D-ai): the variant. The AFP rule needs none because `heap_WHILET`'s partial correctness is a fixpoint statement; ours is a total-correctness `wp` over a deep `while`, so termination has to come from somewhere, and until P1 exports the `nofailT`-to-well-foundedness lemma it comes from `V` |
| conclusion `hn_refine P (heap_WHILET b f s) (Γ * hn_invalid Rs s' s) Rs (monadic_WHILEIT I b' f' s')` | `hnRefine (hnCtxt Rs s₀ d ∗ Γ) (.while cond cbody) Γ d Rs (irWhileIT I bf f s₀)` | P4/D-ah for the post; `irWhileIT` for the abstract side (P4/D-ad) |

The proof is one induction on `V`, and inside it the *whole* iteration
step is `hnr_seq` — body then loop — which is what makes the cost
accounting come out: `hnr_seq` threads the two payments, and the
`ir.while` unit of this iteration's guard is prepaid in front of it by the
same `afford_pay` / `minus_pay` pair `hnr_If` uses. -/

/-- The measured rule. **Not** a `sepref_comb_rules` entry any more
(R0/D-b): `hnr_while` below proves the same conclusion from strictly
fewer premises, and a database entry that is tried and fails costs a
whole body translation (P7/D-bf). It stays compiled — it is the shorter
route when a variant is already at hand, and the acceptance files name
it. -/

/-! ## 4b. The *unfueled* loop rule (ND-MC rebase P0.3, ledger R0/D-b)

P4/D-ai above left the general rule in backlog and named its blocker as
one missing P1 lemma, `nofailT (RECT B s) → ∃ n, fuelIter B n s = RECT B s`.
`NREST/Rec.lean`'s S7 **refutes** that lemma (`NoFuelBound.no_fuel_bound`:
a `mono2` body whose `RECT` does not fail and which no fuel reaches),
so the blocker is not a gap to be filled — the shape was wrong. ℕ-fuel
counts *iterations of the whole state space*, and a body with unbounded
nondeterminism terminates on every branch without any uniform bound.

**R0/D-b — termination is accessibility, not a number.** `LoopTerm` is
the inductive "every run from here reaches an exit": the exit states are
accessible, and a state is accessible when the guard holds and *every*
successor the body can produce is. It is well-founded without being
finitely branching, which is exactly the room the counterexample needs,
and it is a predicate over the *abstract program alone* — no proof idea,
nothing for the caller to invent.

`loopTerm_of_nofailT` is what makes it disappear from the interface: the
loop's own non-failure, which the `hnRefine` judgment hands over for
free, *is* accessibility. The proof is `Rec.lean`'s new
`RECT_eq_top_of_postfixed`, at the post-fixed point that marks the
inaccessible states with `⊤`: a state that is stuck sends the body to
`FAILT`, either because its invariant fails, or because a successor of
its is stuck too, and `bindT` propagates a failing continuation.

So `hnr_while` is `hnr_while_measured` with the `VAR` premise deleted
and nothing put in its place. The measured rule stays compiled (landed
capital, and the shorter proof when a variant is at hand), but leaves
the `sepref_comb_rules` database: everything it can synthesize,

/-! ### Negative control 3 — a failing invariant makes the judgment vacuous

Not a defect: it is the discipline. A loop whose invariant does not hold
at the current state *fails* on the abstract side, and `hnRefine` at a
failing abstract program is trivially true — so the rule proves nothing
there, and this is pinned rather than left implicit. -/

theorem badInv_fails {σ : Type} (bf : σ → Bool) (f : σ → NRest σ ECost) (s : σ) :
    irWhileIT (fun _ => False) bf f s = NRest.fail :=
  irWhileIT_of_not_inv (fun h => h)

theorem badInv_vacuous {σ κ : Type} (bf : σ → Bool) (f : σ → NRest σ ECost) (s : σ)
    (Γ Γ' : Assn) (c : Com) (d : κ) (R : σ → κ → Assn) :
    hnRefine Γ c Γ' d R (irWhileIT (fun _ => False) bf f s) := by
  rw [badInv_fails]
  exact hnr_fail

/-- …and the vacuity is *only* vacuity: the same judgment at a *true*
invariant is the real one, and it is `w_rule` above, which runs. -/
example : wI 0 := trivial

/-! ### Negative control 4 — a loop that genuinely diverges (R0/D-b)

`loopTerm_of_nofailT`'s hypothesis is not decoration. `while true do
skip` — guard always true, body the identity — is nowhere accessible,
and the statement *without* the no-failure hypothesis ("every loop is
`LoopTerm`") is therefore false. What the export says about this loop is
the other half of the same fact: it **is** `FAILT`, which is the
total-correctness reading of the greatest fixed point (`Rec.lean` S2,
`Sanity.RECT_bodyLoop`) and is here derived through the new post-fixed
point rather than from a stability computation. Note also that
`hnr_while` proves the judgment for it — vacuously, exactly as at a
failing invariant, and for the same reason. -/

def dvI : ℕ → Prop := fun _ => True

def dvBf : ℕ → Bool := fun _ => true

noncomputable def dvF : ℕ → NRest ℕ ECost := fun s => NRest.returnT s

/-- Divergence: no state of the spinning loop is accessible. -/

  intro h

  | @exit s hb => exact absurd hb (by simp [dvBf])

  exact dv_not_loopTerm s (loopTerm_of_nofailT (I := dvI) (NRest.nofailT_iff.mpr h))

/-- …and the unfueled rule at it says nothing, which is what a rule at a
failing abstract program must say. -/
