Deferred constraints: the port of `thys/sepref/Sepref_Constraints.thy`.

Source pin as `Sepref/Basic.lean`'s header: `isabelle_llvm_time`
@ `42dd7f5` (full SHA `42dd7f59998d76047bb4b6bce76d8f67b53a08b6`),
`thys/sepref/Sepref_Constraints.thy`, fetched whole (420 lines) and
quoted in `plans/word-ram/refinement-tower/p4-sepref-deep-extracts.md`
§5. The theory is 48 lines of object level and 370 of ML; the object
level is ported verbatim below, and the ML — `WITH_SLOT` / `ON_SLOT` /
`create_slot_tac` / `ensure_slot_tac` / `to_slot_tac` /
`solve_constraint_tac` / `safe_constraint_tac` / `constraint_tac` /
`process_constraint_slot` / `solve_constraint_slot` — is re-expressed as
a `MetaM` store plus three tactics.

## Judgment calls

**P4/D-cd — the SLOT is data, not a subgoal.** The source keeps deferred
constraints in a *designated subgoal* of the proof state:
`CONSTRAINT_SLOT (PROP P &&& PROP Q &&& …)`, created by
`create_slot_tac` (`Thm.implies_intr` of `CONSTRAINT_SLOT True`, then
`defer_tac`) and folded into with `insert_slot_rl1`/`insert_slot_rl2`.
That design is forced by Isabelle's substrate: an ML tactic is a
`thm -> thm Seq.seq`, so the *only* channel a tactic has for carrying
state from one step of a proof to another is the goal list itself, and a
goal that must survive arbitrary later tactics has to be protected by a
constant those tactics do not match. Lean's `MetaM` has ordinary mutable
state and first-class `MVarId`s, so the store is an `IO.Ref` holding the
postponed metavariables and the goal list is left alone. Everything the
source's slot buys is kept: constraints accumulate across the whole
synthesis, are processed once at the end, and an unsolved one surfaces
by name. What is *not* kept is the source's ability to `apply` a tactic
to the slot from Isar — the debugging entry points (`sepref_dbg_print_slot`,
`sepref_dbg_constraints`) replace it. Fallback if a consumer needs the
constraints as real goals: `sepref_dbg_constraints` already returns them
as goals; make that the default and drop the store.

**P4/D-ce — one solver, dispatched through the P2 registry.** The
source's `constraint_tac` is a bespoke pair of rule nets
(`constraint_rules` / `safe_constraint_rules`) with a `SAFE` combinator
distinguishing "this rule application is unique" from "this one
backtracks". Both nets are ported as label databases; the *dispatch* into
them is a `TaggedSolver` (`Autoref/Solver.lean`, wave B2), registered for
the head constant `CONSTRAINT`, which is what the brief asks for and
what makes `Sepref/Translate.lean`'s side-condition dispatcher a
one-liner. The `SAFE`-versus-unsafe distinction survives as the two
databases and the order in which `solveStep` consults them.

**P4/D-cf — `CONSTRAINT is_pure R` is the shape that works end to end.**
It is the only constraint waves A–B generate (`recover_pure`,
`frame_thms` 3–5). The safe rules registered below decide it for every
assertion the IR layer defines: `pureAssn` and `invalidAssn` are pure,
`natAssn` and `arrayAssn` are *not*, and the latter two are flagged with
`CN_FALSE` exactly as the source prescribes ("adding safe rules
introducing this can be used to indicate unsolvable constraints early"),
so a synthesis that demands purity of an owning assertion fails at the
constraint rather than in the slot.

**P4/D-cg — `split_constraint_rls` is absent.** The source's
`atomize_conj[symmetric] imp_conjunction all_conjunction conjunction_imp`
turn Isabelle's meta-conjunction `&&&` into object conjunction so that a
composite constraint can be split. Lean has no `&&&`: a rule with several
premises produces several goals, and each is stored separately. Nothing
to port.
