The translate phase: the port of `thys/sepref/Sepref_Translate.thy`.

Source pin as `Sepref/Basic.lean`'s header (`isabelle_llvm_time`
@ `42dd7f5`); the theory was fetched whole (825 lines). Its object level
— the four side-condition markers, `trans_frame_rule`, the `CPR_TAG`
family, `cons_pre_rule`, `hn_refine_synthI` and the two `drop_hn_*`
weakenings — is ported below, and its ML structure `Sepref_Translate`
(lines 137–440) is the specification of the tactics: `side_cond_dispatch_tac`
(its `WITH_concl` case split), `trans_comb_tac`, `gen_trans_op_tac` with
its four named `PHASES'`, `gen_trans_step_tac`, `gen_trans_tac`.

The header comment the port is measured against:

```
The main functionality of the translation phase is to apply refinement
rules. Thereby, the linearity information is exploited to create copies
of parameters that are still required, but would be destroyed by a
synthesized operation. These frame-based rules are in the named theorem
collection sepref_fr_rules […]. Apart from the frame-based rules
described above, there is also a set of rules for combinators, in the
collection sepref_comb_rules, where no automatic copying of parameters
is applied.
```

## Judgment calls

**T1/D-d — the post-abstraction junks pair contexts componentwise.**
(ND-MC rebase tool wave T1.) `junkConjunct` splits a
`hnCtxt (A ×ₐ B) v c` conjunct (`rfl`) and junks the components
recursively. Before this, a leaf engine returning a tuple — the
engine-as-`sepref_fr_rules`-operation idiom the 2A satellite validated
— could not be *bound*: the block's postcondition still owns the tuple
components the continuation did not consume, the ownership mentions the
binder, and the abstraction threw "no junk form for its assertion"
(exactly the R2/D-e stall the P0.2 spike predicted for `wordAssn`, met
here by every engine composition). Acceptance:
`Lax3Proofs.Refine.T1FriProbe.bfsThenSweep`.

**T2/D-e — `bind_ref_tag` constant normalization.** (ND-MC rebase tool
wave T2.) `hnr_bind`'s second premise carries `bind_ref_tag a m`
(`returnT a ≤ m`); for a constant-producing `m` that pins `a`, and the
loop used to recurse at an opaque `a` anyway, so downstream rules
naming a literal value in a cell could not fire (R2D/D-b, 2A′ gap 5 —
both engine waves paid an `assert` op per pinned cell to route around
it: `mopBfsE`, `mopBfsAt`). Now `sideDispatch` recognises the premise
shape, normalizes `m` to `consume (returnT v) κ` (all-transparency
unfolding through the irreducible `mop*` aliases) and, **only after the
opaque route has failed** — every previously green synthesis path is
byte-identical — retries at `a := v` via `pin_bind_premise`, with the
binder-dependent metavariable families re-pointed at constant families
first. Acceptance: `Examples/BoundsProbe.lean` §4 (the R2D/D-b
reproducer shape, synthesizing).

**P4/D-cm — synthesis is by metavariable instantiation, as the source
does it.** A translate goal is `hnRefine Γ ?c ?Γ' d R m` with `?c` and
`?Γ'` assignable: applying a rule *is* the synthesis, the program falls
out of the proof, and no separate term-building recursion exists. This
is the source's own mechanism (`schematic_goal … by sepref`) and it is
also P2's (`Autoref/Translate.lean`, whose `applyRule` assigns the
concrete term the same way; `Autoref/Tool.lean` delta O8 records the one
Lean-specific step, re-marking the goal's metavariables `natural`, which
`Sepref/Definition.lean` does too). The brief's fallback — synthesize
the term by a `MetaM` recursion and prove afterwards — was **not**
needed: `hnRefine`'s telescope instantiates cleanly, and the hand-run
that checked it (`hnr_seq` composing `?c := .seq ?c₁ ?c₂`) is the first
gate case in `Sepref/Definition.lean`.

**P4/D-cn — the scratch-cell pool lives in the precondition, and the
name generator names what is *missing*.** The brief asks for a
fresh-name generator feeding the destination metavariables of
`sepref_fr_rules` entries. Under P4/D-a the destination is a *cell name*
and under P4/D-c a cell is owned or it does not exist: a synthesized
`x := y ⊕ z` needs `junkCell x` in the precondition, and no tactic can
manufacture ownership — the precondition is the theorem's statement,
fixed by the caller. So the allocator *consumes* rather than invents: it
matches the rule's destination conjunct against the `junkCell` conjuncts
the caller supplied, in the order the caller wrote them, and each
allocation removes one from the pool. `freshScratchName` below is
retained for the *message*: when the pool is empty, the failure names
the cell the caller should add (`t1`, `t2`, … avoiding every name in the
goal), which is the actionable form of "no scratch cell left". Fallback
if a caller wants automatic allocation: it belongs in
`Sepref/Definition.lean`, which *builds* the goal and could append the
cells to the precondition before synthesis; the translate loop would not
change.

**P4/D-co — the four `gen_trans_op_tac` phases collapse to two.** The
source's `PHASES' [("Align goal", …), ("Frame rule", trans_frame_rule),
("Recover pure", …), ("Apply rule", …)]` exists because Isabelle's
`resolve_tac` matches a rule's precondition *syntactically*: the goal
must first be rewritten into `args ∗ frame` order (align), then split
(frame rule), then the invalid markers upgraded (recover pure), and only
then can the rule apply. `applyFrRule` below does align-and-split in one
step — `frameMatch` pairs by `isDefEq` and emits the permutation as an
`ac_rfl` equality (P4/D-ci) — so the surviving phases are "Recover pure"
(run once, on the whole precondition, when it holds an `hn_invalid`) and
"Apply rule". The two lost phases are still *available*: `align_goal`
and `trans_frame_rule` are ported and exposed as `sepref_dbg_*`, because
a stalled goal is easier to read in aligned form. Both spellings are
checked against each other in the gate.

**P4/D-cp — `cons_pre_rule` and `CPR_TAG` are ported and unused.** The
source falls back on `cons_pre_rule` when no `sepref_fr_rules` entry
matches directly, generating a frame side condition instead;
`CPR_TAG_rules` align the two assertion structures so that the
consequence rule's higher-order unification has something to bite on.
`applyFrRule` never needs the fallback — it *starts* from a frame
inference, so a rule that matches modulo frame matches on the first try,
and a rule that does not match modulo frame would not be rescued by a
consequence step either. The rules are ported (they are the source's,
and a future `sepref_copy_rules` consumer will want them) and flagged
here as unexercised.

**P4/D-cq — a linear rule scan, not a discriminant net.** The source
builds `Tactic.build_net` over each database. Seven `sepref_fr_rules`
entries and three `sepref_comb_rules` entries do not need indexing, and
P2 made the same call for the same reason (`Autoref/Translate.lean`
delta T1). The abstract side is tried first in every match, which is the
discriminating position, so a non-matching rule costs one failed
`isDefEq`. Fallback: a `DiscrTree` keyed on the abstract program's head
constant, when a database passes ~50 entries.

**P4/D-cr — `TERM (const, ''name'')` premises are absent, and the
failure *names* replace them.** The AFP loop rule carries
`TERM (monadic_WHILEIT, ''cond'')` and `TERM (monadic_WHILEIT, ''body'')`
premises whose only job is to tell the user *which* frame side condition
failed. Wave B1 dropped them from `hnr_while_measured` (P4/D-ah). What
replaces them is `premiseRole` below: every premise a comb rule
produces is named — "the guard", "the 'then' branch", "the loop body",
"the branch merge" — and the name appears in the envelope when it
stalls. This is the plan's supervision-legibility watch item, and it is
strictly more informative than the source's tags, which name only the
two `while` frames.

**P4/D-cs — the deliberate absences.** `hn_RECT'` / `hn_RCALL` (ledger
D6: no recursion), `mop_free` / `hnr_freeI` (P4/D-d: no dealloc),
`Sepref_Import_Param` (the whole "Import of Parametricity Theorems"
subsection — its consumer is `sepref_import_param`, which nothing in the
acceptance path uses, and its content is a chain of Isabelle-specific
rule surgeries), `import_rel1` / `import_rel2` (same subsection),
`GEN_ALGO` (P2's `Autoref/Tool.lean` already registers the solver; no
Sepref rule emits the tag), `INDEP` (P2 delta: relator independence is
Isabelle schematic-variable hygiene, which Lean metavariables do not
need), `M.mono_body` (recursion again), and the `bounds_tac` /
`sepref_bounds_*` family (the source's arithmetic side-condition solver
for fixed-width LLVM integers; our values are unbounded `ℕ` until the
existing `Bounds`/`Transfer` boundary, design record §6, so there are no
bounds obligations to solve).

/-! ### `hn_bind`, the source's own bind rule (P4/D-ct)

Wave A landed `hnr_seq`, the port of `hnr_bind_manual_free`, whose second
premise delivers the *final* postcondition directly. The source's
`hn_bind` (`Sepref_Translate.thy` l. 476) instead lets the body have its
own postcondition `Γ2 x x'` and adds the premise
`Γ2 x x' ⊢ hn_ctxt Rx x x' ∗ Γ'`, freeing the bound variable's remainder
with `MK_FREE Rx fr`. That extra premise is not decoration: the body's
postcondition *mentions the bound abstract value* (after `x := a + b`,
the frame owns `hn_ctxt natAssn x "t"`), and the caller's `Γ'` is fixed
outside the binder, so without a step that abstracts the binder away
there is nothing `Γ'` can be. Under P4/D-d the free program is gone and
`hn_ctxt Rx x x' ∗ Γ'` collapses to a plain entailment `Γ2 x ⊢ Γ'`,
which is what `IMP` is below — the binder-dependent conjuncts weaken to
junk (`natAssn_entails_junkCell`, `arrayAssn_entails_junkArray`) and the
rest passes through. `Sepref/Translate.lean`'s `abstractPost` is the
tactic that solves it, and it is where the linearity discipline actually
bites: a value bound by `do x ← …` is dead at the end of the block, and
its cell is junk.

`hnr_seq` stays registered: when the body's postcondition happens to be
binder-free it applies directly and needs no `IMP`. -/

/-! ### Tuple states: the pairing operation (P4/D-cu)

A loop whose state is a tuple needs two things the per-op layer does not
supply: an assertion that *is* the tuple (wave A's `prodAssn`, which
`hnCtxt_prodAssn` splits definitionally) and an operation that *builds*
one from two cells. The second is new here. It compiles to `Com.skip` —
nothing happens at run time, the two cells already hold the components —
and therefore costs one `ir.skip`, which is what the abstract side pays.
The source needs no analogue: its concrete language returns values, so a
tuple is `return (a, b)` at zero cost. Ours is a statement language
(design record §5), so "the result is these two cells" is an operation.

Recorded here rather than in `Sepref/IrOps.lean` because that file is
wave B1's and frozen; the natural home is next to the mop layer, and
moving it there is a two-line edit whenever B1 thaws. -/

/-! ### The loop variant, as an annotation (P4/D-cv — **CLOSED**)

`hnr_while_measured` (wave B1, P4/D-ai) takes an explicit variant
`V : σ → ℕ`. Nothing in the goal determines it, and no side-condition
solver can invent it: it is a *proof idea*, and the source does not have
to invent one either (its `heap_WHILET` is a partial-correctness
fixpoint, so it has no termination obligation at all — P4/D-ai records
why ours does). The vehicle was therefore the one P2 already established
for facts the caller has to supply (`Autoref/Tool.lean` delta O1): a
hypothesis in the local context. `LOOP_VARIANT` names the shape so that
the hypothesis is recognisable, and the side-condition fallback's own
`assumption` is what unifies `?V` with the caller's choice.

**How the flag closed (ND-MC rebase P0.3, ledger R0/D-a, R0/D-b).** Not
the way this note predicted. The escape it named — "when P1 exports
`nofailT (RECT B s) → ∃ n, fuelIter B n s = RECT B s`" — is **false**,
and `NREST/Rec.lean`'s `NoFuelBound.no_fuel_bound` refutes it: a `mono2`
body whose `RECT` does not fail at a state that no ℕ-fuel ever reaches,
because unbounded nondeterminism terminates on every branch with no
uniform bound. What P1 exports instead is `RECT_eq_top_of_postfixed` —
"a post-fixed point that is `⊤` at a state pins `RECT` to `⊤` there" —
and termination comes out as the accessibility predicate
`Sepref/CombRules.lean`'s `LoopTerm`, well-founded without being
finitely branching. `loopTerm_of_nofailT` turns the loop's own
non-failure (which the `hnRefine` judgment already hands the rule) into
it, so `hnr_while` needs no termination premise at all.

`hnr_while` is the `sepref_comb_rules` entry now; `hnr_while_measured`
and `hnr_while_var` below are deregistered. Loops synthesize with no
annotation — `Sepref/Definition.lean`'s `sumLoopFree` is the
demonstration, the same program as `sumLoop` from a `sepref_synth` with
no hypothesis at all. `LOOP_VARIANT` itself is kept (deprecated): the
acceptance files' variant lemmas and the `hv` hypotheses of their
landed synthesis theorems are stated in it, and those are capital, not
scaffolding to delete. New consumers should supply nothing. -/

/-! ### The side-condition dispatcher (source lines 300–331) -/

/-- The source's fallback side tactic (`side_fallback_tac`), at P3's
fixed list, plus `apply_assumption` (P7/D-bh).

`assumption` cannot instantiate a quantifier, and a `LOOP_VARIANT` for
an *inner* loop is quantified: the loop's body mentions values the
enclosing `hnr_bind` has abstracted (`scanLoop`'s offered distance and
row end are read from arrays), so the caller can only supply
`∀ dv1 kend, LOOP_VARIANT …`. P4/D-cv's vehicle — "a hypothesis in the
local context, and `assumption` is what unifies `?V` with the caller's
choice" — therefore has no nested-loop instance at all without this.
`apply_assumption` sits *after* `omega`, so it is reached only where the
cheap closers have already failed, and before `simp_all`, which is what
was grinding on the quantified goal instead.

**R0/D-b note.** The instance that motivated it is gone: no rule in the
database reads a `LOOP_VARIANT` any more, so no side condition is a
quantified caller hypothesis today. `apply_assumption` is kept — it is
the general form of `assumption`, one entry in a `first` chain, and
nothing measured says it costs anything now that the loop rule closes
its own termination. Removing it is a separate, testable change. -/

/-! ### T2/D-e — the constant normalization of `bind_ref_tag`

`hnr_bind`'s second premise is `∀ a, bind_ref_tag a m → hnRefine … (f a)`,
and for a constant-producing `m` the tag *pins* `a`. The loop below
recognises that shape, normalizes `m` down to `consume (returnT v) κ`
(unfolding through the `mop*` aliases, irreducible ones included — the
`attribute [irreducible]` idiom is routing, not hiding), and — **only
after the ordinary opaque route has failed**, so every previously green
synthesis takes a byte-identical path — retries the premise through
`pin_bind_premise` at `a := v`. Downstream rules naming a literal value
in a cell then fire by `isDefEq`. The binder-dependent metavariable
families the rule created (`Γ₂ a`) are re-pointed at constant families
first, so the pinned goal stays first-order. -/

/-- The value a constant-producing program pins: `m`, unfolded (all
transparency) to `consume (returnT v) κ`, delivers `v`. Fueled: the
`mop*` aliases are two unfoldings deep, and an engine-sized term that
is *not* constant-producing should not be unfolded to the bottom just
to learn that. -/

/-! ### The translation loop (source lines 335–430) -/

/-- **The order the combinator database is tried in (P7/D-bf).**

`hnr_bind` subsumes `hnr_seq`: its extra premise is `∀ a, Γ₂ a ⊢ Γ'`,
which `abstractPost` discharges by `entails_refl` exactly when the
body's postcondition is binder-free — which is exactly when `hnr_seq`
applies. So whichever of the two is tried first, the program that comes
out is the same `Com.seq c₁ c₂`.

The *cost* is not the same. `hnr_seq` tried first translates the whole
continuation, discovers at the end that the frame mentions the bound
value, and throws the translation away; `hnr_bind` then does it again.
That is a factor of two per `bindT`, and it compounds down a nested
program: a body with `k` binds costs `2^k`, and an inner loop's body is
re-translated once per outer retry on top of that. Measured before the
change: a three-read body with two nested branches stalls after 3 min
22 s and a three-level program does not finish in nine minutes.

The fix is a stable partition, not a sort: everything keeps its
database order except `hnr_seq`, which moves to the back. It stays in
the database because it is the rule that applies with no `IMP` premise
at all, and a caller reading a synthesis proof should still see it
where it is the honest one. -/
