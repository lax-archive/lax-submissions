# `BRefine` — the bounds half of a synthesis (promoted), and its tooling

ND-MC rebase tool wave T2. The `BRefine` judgment was built by the P0.2
spike (`Sepref/Examples/WordAssnSpike.lean` §4) as the answer to R2/D-b:
what the bounds pass needs is not a bounded assertion but a **second
component of the judgment** that transports `Ir.bpre` alongside the
synthesis. Three engine waves then consumed it from the spike file and
measured the tool debts this file pays.

## Judgment calls (T2 ledger)

**T2/D-a — the core is promoted here; the spike re-exports.** Every
name keeps its spike-era full identifier
(`Lax62Proofs.Refine.Sepref.WordSpike.*`): the ND-MC satellites import
the spike path and `open … WordSpike`, and the promotion must not move
a single consumer. So this file declares into the same `WordSpike`
namespace and the spike imports it; nothing else changes. §1–§2 are
the spike's §4, verbatim.

**T2/D-b — the nested-`while` rules.** `BRefine.while_guard` proves a
loop at *its own* `LoopAssn`; a loop inside another loop's body needs
(i) its assertion entered from whatever the outer body holds at that
point, (ii) the cells the inner loop does not touch framed around it,
and (iii) its exit *re-opened* — the continuation must learn which
abstract state the inner loop stopped at and that its guard is false.
`ExitAssn` is the exit shape, `BRefine.while_nested` is (i)+(ii)+(iii)
packaged at a `.while` command, and `BRefine.while_seq` is the form a
body actually contains — `(.while b c).seq d` — with the continuation
entered per exit state. This is AugmentSynth §10 gap 3 and ElimSynth3
§5 debt E3: every two-level engine pass was blocked on exactly this.
Exercised on the counting-pass shape in `Examples/BoundsProbe.lean`.

**T2/D-c — junk-cell rules.** A scratch cell is `junkCell` in a loop
assertion, and `BRefine` had only `pre_ex` to open it — so every loop
carried its scratch values as an n-tuple existential and paid ~20
lines of open/close per body (ScatterSynth's seven-tuple `markΓ`,
AugmentSynth's four-tuple `prefΓ`). `BRefine.pre_junk` opens one junk
cell directly, and the `*_junk` op rules consume a junk *destination*
with no opening at all, which is what a loop-body derivation actually
wants: scratch enters junk, is written, and is weakened back to junk
at the close (`natAssn_entails_junkCell`, already a `fri_rules`
member).

**T2/D-d — the `sepref_brefine_rules` database and the `brefine`
driver.** The op rules below are tagged into the database
(`Sepref/Attrs.lean`), and the `brefine` tactic walks a `.seq` chain
emitting per-op the `BRefine.perm … (by sepref_ac) … ∘ BRefine.frame`
glue that AugmentSynth §10 gap 1 measures at ~150 hand lines per
engine: it matches the op's conjuncts with `Frame.frameMatch` (the
same matcher the synthesis driver uses), frames the remainder, opens
pure conjuncts (`pre_pure`) as it goes, and leaves exactly the goals a
human must own — arithmetic side conditions its fallback cannot close,
`while` sub-goals (whose invariants are proof ideas), and the final
entailment into the caller's loop assertion. A named assertion (a
`def` folding a `∗`-chain) is unfolded before matching, which also
retires the R2A/D-f illegibility for this driver's goals.

**T2/D-f — the run adapter (`BRefine_of_run`).** The 2A′ satellite's
R2A/D-l: composing `BRefine` through an *engine leaf* means passing an
assertion through a whole synthesized `Com`, and the tower's bound for
such a program exists as `bpre` facts and `BigStepB` runs, not as
`BRefine` rules — and `bpre` (all runs) versus the run a consumer
holds (one run) do not bridge syntactically. They bridge semantically:
`Ir.BigStep` is deterministic, so **one bounded run pins every run**,
and `bpre_of_bigStepB` below turns a `BigStepB` derivation into
`Ir.bpre` at *any* postcondition the final state satisfies (the
`while` clause is re-established by `bpre_while_step`, with the
derivation's own loop-head states as the invariant). `BRefine_of_run`
packages it: an engine leaf is a `BRefine` as soon as, from every
state its precondition describes, some bounded run lands back in its
postcondition — which is exactly the ∃-form that
`exists_bigStepB_of_hnRefine` + the engine's own spec deliver. The
per-engine assembly (whose spec lemmas name the engine's arrays)
belongs to the engine waves; the bridge itself is here and gated.

Refute-before-prove: every new *reasoning* rule of this file has a
negative control in §7 (`no_bpre_nested` refutes through two loop
levels; `no_brefine_const_junk_at_bound` bites the junk rule's
creation site; `no_run_at_bound` shows the adapter's premise is not
manufacturable). The driver is MetaM code, exempt, and covered by
keeping every consumer green plus the gate examples it emits here.

/-! ## 1. `BRefine` — the component the bounds pass actually needs
(moved verbatim from the spike's §4; T2/D-a)

R2/D-b, built. `Codegen/Cash.lean` wants `∃ s' κ, Ir.BigStepB B c s₀ s' κ`,
and `BigStep.exists_bigStepB_of_inv` reduces that to `Ir.bpre B c Q s₀`.
`bpre` is *syntax-directed on the concrete `Com`*, exactly like
`hnRefine`'s translate phase, so it can be carried alongside the
judgment by rules of the same shape.

`BRefine B Γ c Γ'` is that second component, in continuation-passing
form: from any state the precondition holds of, under the state
invariant `Ir.StateBound B`, the residual bounds precondition holds.

**No `wordAssn` appears in it.** The abstract values are pinned by
ordinary `natAssn`/`arrayAssn` ownership — `natAssn m y` says the cell
`y` holds *exactly* `m`.

**R2/D-d — credits are threaded existentially, and the assertions must
be credit-free.** `bpre` knows nothing about credits, so the
continuation quantifies the balance. Every data assertion used with
`BRefine` must therefore own no `¤` conjunct; all of
`natAssn`/`arrayAssn`/`junkCell`/`junkArray` qualify. -/

entered from whatever the preceding operations left (`hinit`), the
cells it does not touch ride around it (`D`), and the continuation
needs to know *which* abstract state it stopped at and that the guard
is false. `ExitAssn` carries exactly that, and `while_seq` re-opens it
per exit state. -/

weakening it back to junk at the loop close is

/-! ## 5. T2/D-f — the run adapter

The ∀/∃ bridge for engine leaves (2A′'s R2A/D-l). `bpre` demands a
clause at every run; a consumer holds *one* bounded run; and the
language is deterministic, so the one run pins them all. The content is
`bpre_of_bigStepB` — a `BigStepB` derivation is an `Ir.bpre` at any
postcondition its final state satisfies — whose `while` case
re-establishes the invariant-existential from the derivation itself
(`bpre_while_step`). `BRefine_of_run` then turns "some bounded run from
every `Γ`-state lands in a `Γ'`-state" into the judgment, which is the
∃-form an engine's `hnRefine` + spec + `exists_bigStepB_of_hnRefine`
deliver. -/

Walks a `.seq` chain, emitting per operation the permutation/frame glue
around a `sepref_brefine_rules` entry — exactly the
`BRefine.perm … (by sepref_ac) … ∘ BRefine.frame` bookkeeping the
engine waves authored by hand. Pure conjuncts are opened as they are
produced (`pre_pure`, with the fact introduced into the context so the
side conditions downstream can use it). What is left open, in order:
arithmetic side conditions the fallback (`assumption`/`decide`/`omega`,
with the `Bop.apply` spellings normalized) cannot close, `while`-headed
sub-goals (their invariants are proof ideas — `while_guard`/`while_seq`
consume them, and a `while` in seq position is left in `while_seq`'s
own shape), and the final entailment into a concrete target assertion
(`loopAssn_intro`'s job). -/

/-! ### T2/D-c and T2/D-d controls: the junk rules and the driver

Positive: a junk destination is written and then accumulated into,
straight off the database — the whole two-op chain is driver-emitted,
no `pre_ex`, no hand permutation. Negative: the junk form does not
weaken the creation site — `x := 8` at `B = 8` from a junk cell has no
`BRefine` at any exit, because `bpre` is false at a state that owns the
cell. -/

/-! ### T2/D-b controls: the nested loop

Positive: an inner loop entered from a plain assertion through
`while_nested`, cashed to an `Ir.bpre` witness at `bState` — the layer
agreement (`hg`) and the exit shape are both exercised (the full
two-level `while_seq` composition is the probe's). Negative: an inner
creation site that overflows refutes the judgment *through both loop
levels* — whatever invariants are offered, they hold at the entry
states and force the overflowing `binop`'s side condition. -/

/-- The inner loop of the controls: `while (j < m) { j := j + z }`. -/
def innerNest : Com :=
  Com.while (Cond.lt (Operand.cell "j") (Operand.cell "m")) (Com.binop .add "j" "j" "z")

consumed by `bpre_of_bigStepB` — the `while` clause of the bridge, at a
concrete run. Positive II: the adapter derives an op's `BRefine` from
runs alone, agreeing with the rule layer. Negative: the adapter's
premise cannot be manufactured — at `B = 7` no bounded run of the
overflowing `binop` exists at all, from any state owning the cells. -/
