/-!
The ir-currency operation layer: the abstract `mop_…` operations of the
IR's op set, and the `hn_refine` rule for each.

Provenance. The *layer* is the artifact's
(`thys/sepref/…`+`thys/nrest/Monadic_Operations.thy`, pin
`isabelle_llvm_time` @ `42dd7f5` per `plans/word-ram/refinement-tower/design.md`
§1): an interface operation `mop_x` that asserts its precondition and
`consume`s an explicit cost, plus one `hn_refine` rule per operation
registered in `sepref_fr_rules`. The *content* is ours, and flagged: the
artifact's `mop_…`s take their cost as a parameter (`mop_array_nth`'s
`cost ''load'' 1` is supplied by the IICF instance), while ours are
**pinned to the IR's own currencies** — design record F4, "cost
currencies survive down to the IR (per-op currencies); collapsing to a
single time unit happens once, in P5's cashing theorem". So there is one
`mop` per IR op, at the currency `Ir/Syntax.lean` declares for that op,
and no cost parameter anywhere.

What each rule is checked against: `Ir/Triples.lean`'s per-op triple
(itself the port of `ll_load_rule`/`ll_store_rule`, p3-sl-deep-extracts
§5) composed with `Sepref/Basic.lean`'s `hnRefineI_spect` (the source's
`hn_refineI_SPECT`). The `hnCtxt` discipline of the statements is the
source's (`hn_ctxt` keeps frame matching syntax-directed —
p4-sepref-extracts §3), and it is what wave C's frame inferencer will
consume.

## Judgment calls (P4/D-aa … , continuing `Basic.lean`'s D-a … D-p)

`P4/D-aa` is in `Sepref/Attrs.lean` (where the three rule databases are
declared).

**P4/D-ab — the destination is a `junkCell` in the precondition, not an
allocation.** The source's per-op rules deliver their result into a
*fresh* SSA register that the shallow monad conjures (`hn_refine … (f c)`
returns a value). Our IR is three-address over a fixed name space with no
allocation (design record §6, ledger D2), so the destination cell must
already exist and be owned: every rule whose destination is a scratch
cell takes `junkCell x` in the precondition and returns
`natAssn v x` in the judgment's result slot. This is what wave A's
P4/D-c/P4/D-f anticipated ("a cell owned at the start of a run is owned
at its end"), and it is the exact place where the substrate's
no-allocation property is paid for: the *caller* owns the scratch cell,
so wave C's translate phase must supply a scratch name rather than a
fresh register (handoff note, §6). Fallback: none needed — `junkCell` is
`deadAssn natAssn` (`Basic.lean`'s `deadAssn_natAssn_eq_junkCell`), so a
temporary invalidated by an earlier op is *already* in the shape the next
op's precondition wants.

**P4/D-ac — no name-distinctness side conditions.** `∗` on cell
assertions is already false when two names coincide
(`Assn.lean`'s `ptoVar_sepConj_self`), so `hnr_mop_binop` needs no
`x ≠ y`: the rule is simply inapplicable in the aliased case. This is
P3's judgment call D-w, inherited. Where in-place update is *wanted* —
`i := i + one`, every loop's step — the aliased instance is its own rule
(`hnr_mop_binop_self`, off P3's `binop_self_triple`), destructive in `x`
exactly as `hnr_mop_aset` is destructive in the array.

**P4/D-ad — `irWhileIT` is `monadic_WHILEIT` at a *pure* guard and the
`ir.while` currency, defined through the source's own `RECT'` shape.**
The source's `monadic_WHILEIT I b f s` (a) takes the guard as a
*computation* `b : α ⇒ (bool,_) nrest`, (b) pays `cost ''call'' 1` on
entry and per iteration, and (c) routes the branch through `MIf`, which
pays `cost ''if'' 1` as well. The IR's `while` op evaluates a
*structural* `Ir.Cond` and charges one `ir.while` per guard evaluation
and nothing else (P3 ledger D-h): `n` iterations charge `n + 1`. So
`irWhileIT` keeps (b) verbatim at `Currency.«while»` — this is the shape
`RECT'` has (`Rec.lean`, the source's `RECT'`: one unit on entry and one
per recursive call), with the currency a parameter instead of the
hard-wired `''call''` — and drops (a) and (c), which have no IR
counterpart. The invariant `assert (I s)` stays exactly where the source
puts it, and is load-bearing: `hnr_while_measured` reads `I s` *off the
abstract program's non-failure*, so no `INV` premise is needed
(`CombRules.lean`, P4/D-ai).

**P4/D-ae — the branch exchange is an equality, the loop exchange an
inequality with a variant.** §4 proves
`timerefine E (MIf b t e) = irIf b (timerefine E t) (timerefine E e)`
as an *equality*, at general `E` with the two hypotheses the equality
needs (`wfR'' E`, `E "if" = ACost.cost Currency.ite 1`): `⇓C` commutes
with `consume` exactly (P1's `timerefine_consume`), so no inequality
creeps in. §5 proves the `monadic_WHILEIT` analogue as
`irWhileIT … ≤ timerefine E (monadicWhileIT …)` — the *useful* direction,
since `hnRefine_ref` is monotone upward in the abstract program — under
`E "call" = ACost.cost Currency.while 1` and a variant `V`, and the two
reasons it cannot be an equality are recorded there (the source's loop
also pays `''if''` per iteration; `⇓C` through `bindT` is
`timerefine_bindT_ge`, an inequality, because `bindT` is a supremum and
`⇓C` is not supremum-continuous — P1 delta T7). The variant premise is
the same one `CombRules.lean`'s loop rule takes, for the same reason
(P4/D-ai). Both are also available at the concrete map `irE` (§4), which
is all the acceptance needs. Three helper lemmas that P1 does not export
are proved in §5 and belong upstream — result-guarded `bindT`
monotonicity, `mono2` for `monadicWhileBody`, and the pure-guard
unfolding; moving them is a backlog item with no proof content.

/-! ## 4. Exchange (design record F4, P4/D-ae)

The route *in* for a program written at P1's own currencies: `⇓C E` — P1's
`timerefine` — reprices the source's `''if''` / `''call''` into the IR's
`ir.ite` / `ir.while`, and the combinator on the far side is the one this
file defines. `⇓C` commutes with `consume` exactly (`timerefine_consume`),
so the branch exchange is an *equality*; the loop's is not, and §5 says
why. -/

/-- **The branch exchange, as an equality.** `MIf`'s only cost is its own
`''if''` unit, so repricing it is repricing that unit: at any `E` with
`E "if" = ACost.cost Currency.ite 1`, `⇓C E (MIf b t e)` *is*
`irIf b (⇓C E t) (⇓C E e)`. -/
theorem timerefine_MIf {α : Type} {E : String → ECost} (hE : wfR'' E)

statement needs side conditions the consumer would have to carry. -/

/-! ## 5. The loop exchange (P4/D-ae)

What holds, and in which direction. The source's pure-guard
`monadic_WHILEIT` exchanges into `irWhileIT` as an **inequality**

```
irWhileIT I bf (⇓C E ∘ g) s ≤ ⇓C E (monadicWhileIT I (returnT ∘ bf) g s)
```

and this is the useful direction, because `hnRefine` is monotone upward
in the abstract program (`Basic.lean`'s `hnRefine_ref`): a rule proved at
the cheaper left-hand side transfers to the exchanged loop. It is not an
equality, for two independent reasons, both recorded rather than papered
over:

* the source's loop pays `''if''` per iteration as well (its body routes
  the branch through `MIf`, P4/D-ad (c)) and the IR's `while` op has no
  branch charge of its own, so the right-hand side is dearer by one
  `E "if"` per iteration — the *only* hypothesis on `E` is therefore
  `E "call" = ACost.cost Currency.while 1`, and `E "if"` is free;
* `⇓C` through `bindT` holds only as `timerefine_bindT_ge` (P1 delta T7:
  `bindT` is a supremum and `⇓C` is not supremum-continuous).

Like `CombRules.lean`'s loop rule, the statement is **measured**
(P4/D-ai): the induction needs the inductive hypothesis under a bind, at
the states the body can actually produce, so a variant `V` supplies the
well-foundedness. The three lemmas it needs and P1 does not export —
result-guarded `bindT` monotonicity, `mono2` for the source's
`monadicWhileBody`, and the pure-guard unfolding — are proved here and
belong upstream (`NREST/Pw.lean`, `NREST/Combinators.lean`); moving them
is a backlog item with no proof content. -/

/-- **Result-guarded `bindT` monotonicity.** The continuations only have
to compare at the results the bound computation can actually produce.
P1's `Pw.lean` has the unguarded `bindT_mono` only; this belongs next to
it (backlog: move upstream). -/
