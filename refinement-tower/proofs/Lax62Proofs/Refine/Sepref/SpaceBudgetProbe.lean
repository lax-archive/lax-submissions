# The compiled space-budget probe (ledger E29, leaf P4.5.D)

P4.5 repealed "peak memory equals total allocation": with a real
allocator only the **live set plus whatever LIFO cannot reclaim** has to
fit.  That repeal is safe for time and *not* automatically safe for
space, and on the consumer's path space is the scarcer resource.  This
file compiles the space side of the repeal, in both directions, over a
driver-shaped skeleton built from the landed allocator primitives
(`allocProg` / `freeProg` of `Refine/Sepref/HeapAlloc.lean`).

## The hazard this file exists to prevent

A LIFO `free` **decreases** the bump pointer.  So the *final* value of
`hp` is not the *peak*, and a theorem bounding only the final `hp` is
vacuous as a space statement: it is satisfied by a program that
allocates `n ^ (1 + ε)` cells and frees them all.  §7's
`final_hp_is_not_peak` compiles exactly that counterexample — for
`wastefulCom K` the final bump pointer is back where it started while an
intermediate state sits `K` above it — so the difference between the two
statement forms is a theorem here and not a comment.

Everything positive below is therefore stated as `PeakLe`: a bound on
`hpOf s'` for **every** state `s'` the run passes through
(`Mid`, §1), proved by induction over the loop structure (§3's
`peak_while`), never by evaluating the end state.

The gap is not hypothetical, and not confined to a contrived program.
`run_reuseSkel` and `reuse_peak_attained` (§8) give it at the *positive*
skeleton itself: the final bump pointer is `setup` above entry, an
intermediate one is `setup + aw`.  And `no_word_size_for_wasteful` (§9)
closes the circle — `wastefulCom K` satisfies the final-`hp` condition at
every `K` while its peak is refuted at every admissible word length, so
the two statement forms disagree on a concrete program.

## What is compiled

* **§1–§3, the peak calculus.**  `Mid c s s'` is the intermediate-state
  relation of the IR's own big-step semantics: `s'` is `s`, or the end
  of a completed run of `c`, or an intermediate state of a component.
  `NetLe c g` bounds the *net* growth of `hp` across a completed run,
  `PeakLe c p` bounds it at every intermediate state.  The one rule that
  carries the whole argument is `peak_while`: a loop whose body has
  **zero net growth** has the body's peak, *whatever the iteration
  count* — that is LIFO reuse, in the currency the consumer cares about.

* **§4, the skeleton.**  A setup phase sized in `|x|`, then
  `turns × levels` arena passes, in three flavours: `reuseSkel` (each
  pass carves an arena and gives it back — LIFO), `ownedSkel` (the arena
  is allocated once in setup and threaded — caller-owned), `freshSkel`
  (each pass carves a fresh arena and never gives it back).  All
  parameters are symbolic; C0-shaped numbers appear only in `#guard`s.

* **§9b, the shape a real driver has — and the answer to "which of the
  three".**  A recursive per-arena ND-MC-style driver is **none of the
  three above**: it is `nestedSkel`, which within a turn descends
  `levels` deep holding one arena live per level and then unwinds LIFO.
  Its peak is `setup + levels * aw` — `peak_nestedSkel` — so arenas
  compose with **depth** but not with **turns**, strictly between
  `reuseSkel`'s `setup + aw` and `freshSkel`'s
  `setup + turns * levels * aw`.  **What such a driver must maintain to
  stay inside the budget is therefore not "free everything" but
  `levels * aw = O(|x|)`: bounded recursion depth times per-level
  arena.**  That is not assumed here — `nested_fits_iff` is an `↔`, and
  `no_word_size_for_nested` is the compiled statement that it can fail:
  once the depth grows with `n`, no admissible word length rescues the
  descending driver either.

* **§5–§6, the positive result.**  `peak_reuseSkel` and
  `peak_ownedSkel`: the peak growth is `setup + aw`, **independent of
  `turns` and `levels`**.  `reuse_fits_linear` cashes that into
  `Layout.FitsWords` at a word length `w` with `2 ^ w` linear in `|x|`,
  and `reuse_fits_at_admissible_word` (§9) does it at a `w` the C0-shaped
  domain itself admits — which is the comparison the negative result
  demands, since that result kills *every* admissible `w`.

* **§8, the runs.**  A `PeakLe` bound over an unrunnable program says
  nothing, so `run_skel` constructs a symbolic run of all three
  skeletons, `run_countedLoop` doing the counting.
  `reuse_peak_attained` then shows the positive bound is *attained*: it
  is the peak, not a loose over-estimate.

* **§9, the negative control.**  `run_freshSkel` gives the fresh
  variant's bump pointer as
  `hp₀ + setup + turns * levels * aw`.  `no_word_size_for_fresh` is then
  `Lax3Proofs.Refine.BridgeSeamProbe.no_word_size_for_sparse`'s shape:
  for every constant `c` and every instance past that constant's
  crossover, the C0-shaped domain admits a word length `w` at which
  `Layout.FitsWords` and the space budget are **jointly unsatisfiable** —
  no word size rescues the fresh discipline.  The crossover is inhabited
  at `Σ|X_c| = n ^ (3/2)`, i.e. already at *sub-quadratic* fresh
  allocation.

* **§10, registration discipline (E29's other half).**  `mentions
  hpName` is `decide`-checkable, so "synthesis may not pick an
  allocating form inside a loop" is a compiled check: the loop interior
  of `ownedSkel` does not mention `hpName`, its setup does, and the
  check bites (the reusing interior and `allocProg` both mention it).

## Two things deliberately *not* done

**No import of the consumer.**  The tower cannot depend on ND-MC, so
C0's domain is reproduced in *shape* over `probeWord` — a word of length
`n + 3` whose entries are bounded by `n` — rather than imported.  What is
reproduced is the quantifier order (`c` before the instance, `∀ w` over
the domain), which is the whole of the argument; `EncodesGraph` is not,
and no claim here is about graphs.

**No re-zeroing.**  E27/E28: space freed by LIFO `free` comes back
**raw**, not zeroed (`availRaw`, and `availRaw_not_entails_avail` says
there is no way back).  A skeleton that reuses freed space and then
re-zeroes it would fix the space budget and silently break the time
budget — the same defect in the other currency.  §4's passes are
touched-only, and §10's gate is the compiled check: `hasAset` and
`hasWhile` are `false` of every pass, so no pass can sweep the arena,
and `opCount` is therefore the same at width `0` and width `10 ^ 6`.
§11 pins which availability flavour each skeleton consumes, against the
landed triples.

/-! ## 4. The skeleton

**Driver-shaped, not an arithmetic model.**  Every allocation is the
landed `allocProg` and every deallocation the landed `freeProg`; the
loops are the IR's own `while`; the parameters `setup`, `aw`, `turns`,
`levels` are symbolic and enter the emitted `Com` as literals, so the
theorems below quantify over the whole domain rather than holding at one
instance.

The literal staging (`Com.const "aw" k` immediately before each
`allocProg` / `freeProg`, `Com.const "one" 1` immediately before each
increment) is what makes the steps *unconditional*: no caller has to
have arranged for a cell to hold the right number, so `NetLe` and

/-! ## 7. Why the bound had to be a peak

`wastefulCom K` allocates `K` cells and gives them all back.  Its
**final** bump pointer is exactly where it started — so any "space
bound" phrased on the end state of `BigStep` is satisfied by it, at
every `K`, including `K = n ^ (1 + ε)`.  Its **peak** is `K`.

This is the compiled form of the hazard: the two statement forms are not
equivalent, and only one of them is about space. -/

/-- **A final-`hp` bound is not a space bound.**  Both halves at once:
every completed run of `wastefulCom K` returns the bump pointer to where
it started, and the run passes through a state `K` above it. -/
theorem final_hp_is_not_peak (K : ℕ) {s : State} (hs : Good s) :
    (∀ (s' : State) (κ : Cost), BigStep (wastefulCom K) s s' κ → hpOf s' = hpOf s) ∧
      (∃ s' : State, Mid (wastefulCom K) s s' ∧ hpOf s' = hpOf s + K) := by

/-! The same gap holds at the *reusing* skeleton, which is a program
anyone would want to call correct: `run_reuseSkel` gives its final bump
pointer as `setup` above entry, `reuse_peak_attained` gives an
intermediate state at `setup + aw`.  Both are in §8, after the run
machinery that a *lower* bound on the peak needs. -/

/-! ## 8. The runs, and the fresh variant's climb

The negative direction needs a *lower* bound on the peak, so it needs a
run, not an invariant.  `run_countedLoop` builds one: a loop whose guard
is a literal and whose body ends in `incrCom` runs exactly as many times
as the literal says, and its bump-pointer growth is the body's, times
the count. -/

theorem hpOf_incr {x : String} (hx : x ≠ hpName) (s : State) (j : ℕ) :

  rw [hpOf_setVar_ne hx, hpOf_setVar_ne (Ne.symm hp_ne_one)]

/-- **A counted loop runs exactly as often as its literal bound says.**
`keep` is the frame: cells the body leaves alone and that the loop
therefore also leaves alone, which is how the level loop can be nested
inside the turn loop. -/

/-! ## 9. The negative control: no word size rescues fresh allocation

`no_word_size_for_sparse`'s shape, reproduced over the bump pointer.
C0's domain is `{x | … ∧ ∀ v ∈ x, c * (|x| + v + 1) ≤ 2 ^ w}` and the
root theorem quantifies over **all** `w`, so the *smallest admissible*
word length is in scope, where `2 ^ w` is only linear in `|x|`.  Against
that, `turns * levels * aw` — the fresh discipline's total allocation,
`Σ|X_c|` — is superlinear, and the bump pointer is a value of the run,
so it must be below `B ≤ 2 ^ w`.

The word `probeWord n` plays the role C0's sparse instance plays: length
`n + 3`, every entry at most `n`.  It is *not* a graph encoding — the
tower may not import the consumer — and nothing here is a claim about
graphs.  What is reproduced is the quantifier order, which is the whole
of the argument. -/

**jointly unsatisfiable** for the fresh skeleton.  No word size reaches
it: the quantities are `turns * levels * aw` (the fresh total) against
`2 ^ w` (the machine's addressable range), and no cost repair occurs.

Note the shape of the conclusion: what fails is a bound over `Mid`, i.e.
over the states the run passes through.  Since the offending state is
reached by `run_freshSkel`, the refutation is of a peak bound and *a

/-! ## 9b. The descending skeleton — the shape a real driver actually has

`reuseSkel` and `ownedSkel` say arenas never accumulate at all;
`freshSkel` says they accumulate as `turns * levels * aw`.  A recursive
per-arena driver is **neither**: within one turn it descends `levels`
deep, holding one arena live at each level while it recurses, and then
unwinds, freeing LIFO.  Its arenas accumulate *within* a turn and not
*across* turns, so its peak is `setup + levels * aw` — independent of
`turns`, linear in `levels`.

The IR has no recursion (ledger D6) and does not need it: a descent loop
that allocates without freeing followed by an ascent loop that frees LIFO
has exactly the recursion's allocation trace, which is the only thing
under test.  The ascent counts the depth cell back down, so the two loops
share one counter and no new cell is reserved.

The peak calculus of §3 does not reach this on its own: the descent's
body has **non-zero** net growth, so `peak_while` does not apply.
`peak_while_pot` below is `peak_while` with a potential — the allocation
still to come — and it is what turns "the body grows, but only `levels`
times" into a bound. -/

/-! ### The fits statement, as an `↔`

The question the consumer actually has to answer is not "does it fit"
— for a big enough word length everything fits — but **how large a word
length the shape demands**.  Both directions are available here, because
the peak is both bounded (`peak_nestedSkel`) and attained
(`nested_peak_attained`), so the following is an `↔` and not an
implication. -/

open Lax13Proofs.Compile in
/-- **The descending skeleton fits the probe's layout at word length `w`
iff `2 ^ w` covers `setup + levels * aw` plus the layout's own
constant.**  `→` is the attainment, `←` is the peak bound; `turns`
occurs on neither side.

Read asymptotically, this is the statement the leaf exists to make: the
descending driver fits a word length **linear in `|x|` exactly when
`levels * aw` is linear in `|x|`** — bounded recursion depth times
per-level arena.  It is not assumed; it is the two directions above. -/

/-! ## 11. Which availability flavour each skeleton consumes

E27/E28, made explicit rather than left to the prose.  Both statements
are instantiations of the landed triples of `HeapAlloc.lean`, at the
skeleton's own cell names — so if the flavour ever changed, these would
stop typechecking. -/

/-- **The first reusing pass degrades `avail` to `availRaw`.**  What the
arena gives back is raw, not zeroed: `availRaw_not_entails_avail` says
there is no way back, and re-zeroing would cost `O(aw)`. -/
example (aw k old hp : ℕ) :
    irTriple (¤(allocCost aw + freeCost aw) ∗ ("arena" ↦ᵥ old) ∗ avail hp (aw + k) ∗
        ("aw" ↦ᵥ aw))
      ((allocProg "arena" "aw").seq (freeProg "aw"))
      (("arena" ↦ᵥ hp) ∗ availRaw hp (aw + k) ∗ ("aw" ↦ᵥ aw)) :=
  alloc_free_roundtrip "arena" "aw" old hp aw k

/-- **Every later reusing pass consumes `availRaw` and returns it**, in
O(1) — which is why the peak does not grow with `turns`. -/
example (k old p : ℕ) (xs : List Val) :
    irTriple (¤(freeCost xs.length + allocCost xs.length) ∗ ("arena" ↦ᵥ old) ∗ (p ↦ₕ xs) ∗
        availRaw (p + xs.length) k ∗ ("aw" ↦ᵥ xs.length))

        ("aw" ↦ᵥ xs.length)) :=
