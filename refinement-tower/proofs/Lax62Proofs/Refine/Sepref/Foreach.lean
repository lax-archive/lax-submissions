# Sepref lowering for currency-vector member iteration

This is tower-expansion P2.A's authored `Sepref_Foreach` adaptation
(ledger E5).  The source rule architecture is preserved: an abstract
`nfoldli` rule is discharged by a lower-level iterator implementation and
then lifted through `hnRefine_ref`.  The concrete acceptance iterator is a
masked index walk over a member array; the carrier is framed read-only and
never supplies the loop bound.

/-! ## Source-shaped bridge rule -/

/-- Sepref iteration bridge: once an iterator implementation refines an
abstract `nfoldli`, its compiled `hnRefine` theorem is a theorem for that
fold.  This is the Lean rendering of the source's iterator hnr-rule
conclusion; concrete iterator interfaces supply `LOWER`. -/
