# The `wordAssn` spike (ND-MC rebase P0.2)

The P8 verdict's option (b), built and measured. §2 item 2 of
`plans/word-ram/refinement-tower/p8-verdict.md` priced the **bounds
pass** at 560 Lean lines and named it the one genuinely new per-program
cost of the tower; §3 (b) proposed retiring it by moving `< B` *into
the assertions* — a `wordAssn B` whose ownership carries the bound,
with arithmetic `hnr` rules that surface `< B` as synthesis side
conditions, "the source's own architecture, where machine words carry
the bound in the type".

This file builds that layer and reports what it does and does not buy.
Everything here is new; nothing existing is edited.

## The three findings, up front

**R2/D-a — `wordAssn` is `natAssn` wherever it is inhabited.**
`wordAssn B a c := natAssn a c ∗ ⌜a < B⌝` is a *pure* extension, so
`wordAssn_of_lt` says `a < B → wordAssn B a c = natAssn a c` and
`wordAssn_of_ge` says `¬ a < B → wordAssn B a c = sepFalse`. The
assertion therefore carries no resource the plain one does not; the
whole content is the side condition. §2 makes that formal, and it is
why §3's bounded rule layer is *derived* from the existing rules in
three lines each rather than re-proved from the triples.

**R2/D-b — the bound is not what the bounds pass needs, and the
assertion is not where it is missing.** `Codegen/Cash.lean`'s
`spec_of_hnRefine` asks for `∃ s' κ, Ir.BigStepB B c s₀ s' κ`, and
`hnRefine`'s conclusion is a `wp` over the *plain* `Ir.BigStep`.
Adding a pure conjunct to `hnRefine`'s postcondition changes nothing
about the run, so a synthesis carried out entirely in `wordAssn` still
leaves `bfsQ_bpre` exactly where it was. What the pass actually needs is
a **second component of the judgment** that transports `bpre`. §4 builds
it (`BRefine`), and the striking part is that it needs no assertion
change at all: `natAssn m y` already *names* the abstract value `m` held
by the cell `y`, which is precisely the identification
`Examples/BfsQSynth.lean` §12 spends its `Option.some.inj` chains
re-establishing against `Ir.State`.

**R2/D-c — `wordAssn` cannot reach an engine-sized synthesis without a
`Translate.lean` edit.** `Sepref/Translate.lean`'s `junkConjunct` (the
tactic behind `hnr_bind`'s `IMP` premise) dispatches on the *constant*
`natAssn` / `arrayAssn` to find a conjunct's junk form. `wordAssn B` is
an application, so every `do x ← …` that binds a scalar throws
"there is no junk form for its assertion". §5's probe *reproduces* that
failure on a two-operation program, and the P6/D-bc wrapper idiom does
not help, because by R2/D-a the wrapper is the identity.

Taken together: option (b) as written is *insufficient*; the thing it is
a proxy for — creation-site `< B` as a rule side condition, discharged
against the abstract program rather than against `Ir.State` — is real,
is built here as `BRefine`, and does not need `wordAssn`.

/-! ## 1. The bounded assertions

`wordAssn B` is `natAssn` with the bound as a pure conjunct — the exact

/-! ## 2. R2/D-a: the assertion *is* the side condition, and nothing else

A pure conjunct owns no resource. So a `wordAssn` is either the plain
`natAssn` (when the bound holds) or the empty assertion (when it does
not) — there is no third case, and in particular no state in which
`wordAssn` restricts a run that `natAssn` admits. -/

/-! ## 3. The bounded rule layer

One rule per operation an engine actually uses, each consuming and
producing `wordAssn`/`wordArrayAssn`, each surfacing its *creation-site*
`< B` as a side condition. R2/D-a is what makes them cheap: the
precondition and the frame rewrite to the plain assertions, and the only
real work is the result slot, which is `hnRefine_augment_res`. -/

/-- The result-slot lemma: a `consume (returnT a)` program admits exactly
`a`, so a bound on `a` bounds every admissible result. -/

/-- Upgrade a `natAssn`-result judgment to a `wordAssn`-result one. This

*definitionally* the augmented relator. -/

      ∀ v ∈ a, v < B) :
    hnRefine Γ c Γ' x (wordArrayAssn B) m := hnRefine_augment_res A Bd

/-! ### Vacuity: an unsatisfiable precondition needs no rule

R2/D-a's negative half, put to work. If a rule's precondition owns a
`wordAssn B` at an out-of-range value it owns `sepFalse`, and an
`hnRefine` with an unsatisfiable precondition is *free*. So the operand
bounds need not be side conditions at all — which is the difference
between a rule the synthesis can fire and one it cannot (R2/D-e). -/

/-! ### The rules

**R2/D-e — the only side conditions are the creation sites.** Every
operand bound is discharged by vacuity above, and every index bound by
the `mop`'s own `assert` (`hnr_assert`). What is left is `n < B` at
`const` and `op.apply m n < B` at `binop` — exactly P7/D-bl's residual,
and exactly the goals the synthesis has to hand to the caller. -/

and they are not needed, because a rule whose precondition is
uninhabitable holds for free. Note that they would not suffice either:

**Promoted (T2/D-a).** The judgment this section built — `BRefine`, its
structural and op rules, `LoopAssn` and the loop rules — is the layer
every ND-MC engine wave consumes, and tool wave T2 moved it to
`Sepref/Bounds.lean` (imported above, same `WordSpike` namespace, every
name unchanged) together with the debts the engine waves measured
against it: the nested-`while` rules (T2/D-b), the junk-cell rules
(T2/D-c), the `sepref_brefine_rules` database with the `brefine` driver
(T2/D-d) and the run adapter (T2/D-f). What this section retains is its
finding: what the bounds pass needs is a second *judgment* component
transporting `Ir.bpre` — `natAssn m y` already names the abstract value

/-! ### Negative controls for §3: every side condition bites

Four families, one refutation each.

1. **The operand bounds** (`hm`/`hn`/`hxs`/`hk` of every rule). A
   `wordAssn` at an out-of-range value is not a weaker assertion, it is
   `sepFalse`: the rule is inapplicable because its precondition owns
   nothing. -/

example : wordAssn 8 8 "x" = (sepFalse : Assn) := wordAssn_of_ge (by decide)

example : wordArrayAssn 8 [1, 9, 3] "A" = (sepFalse : Assn) :=
  wordArrayAssn_of_not_mem (by decide)

/-! 2. **The `aget`/`aset` index bound** (`hklen`). Without it the
abstract operation is `fail`, and a `fail` has no `hnRefine` consumer at
all — `hnRefine`'s first premise is `m.nofailT`. -/

example : mopAget [1, 2, 3] 5 = NRest.fail := by
  rw [mopAget_def, NRest.assert_neg (by decide), NRest.bindT_fail]

example : mopAset [1, 2, 3] 5 0 = NRest.fail := by
  rw [mopAset_def, NRest.assert_neg (by decide), NRest.bindT_fail]

/-! 3. **The `const` creation site** (`hn`). `x := 8` at `B = 8` has no
`wordAssn 8` judgment — not because the rule refuses to fire, but
because the conclusion is *false*: the vehicle would give `8 < 8`. -/

theorem mopConstN_gate (n : ℕ) :
    mopConstN n = NRest.rest (NRest.single n ((irUnit Currency.const : ECost) :
      WithBot ECost)) := by
  rw [mopConstN_def, NRest.consume_returnT]

theorem no_constN_word_at_bound :

  by_cases ha : a = 8
  · omega
  · exact hne (NRest.single_of_ne ha _)

/-! 4. **The `binop` creation site** (`hb`) — the row P7/D-bl says cannot
be made state-local. Both operands fit in `B = 7`; their sum does not. -/

theorem mopBinop_gate (op : Imp.Bop) (m n : ℕ) :
    mopBinop op m n = NRest.rest (NRest.single (op.apply m n)
      ((irUnit (binopCurrency op) : ECost) : WithBot ECost)) := by
  rw [mopBinop_def, NRest.consume_returnT]

theorem no_binop_word_at_bound :
    ¬ hnRefine gPre (.binop .add "x" "y" "z")
      (hnCtxt natAssn 3 "y" ∗ hnCtxt natAssn 4 "z" ∗ hnCtxt arrayAssn [1, 2, 3] "A") "x"
      (wordAssn 7) (mopBinop .add 3 4) := by
  intro h
  obtain ⟨a, hne, hlt⟩ := res_lt_of_hnRefine_wordAssn (F := gFrame)
    h (mopBinop_gate .add 3 4) gPre_holds
  by_cases ha : a = Imp.Bop.apply .add 3 4
  · rw [Imp.Bop.apply_add] at ha; omega
  · exact hne (NRest.single_of_ne ha _)

/-- …and the in-place rule shares that side condition exactly
(`hnr_mop_binop_self_word`'s `hb` is `hnr_mop_binop_word`'s), so the same
refutation covers it. -/
theorem no_binop_self_word_at_bound :
    ¬ hnRefine (hnCtxt natAssn 3 "y" ∗ hnCtxt natAssn 4 "z") (.binop .add "y" "y" "z")
      (hnCtxt natAssn 4 "z") "y" (wordAssn 7) (mopBinop .add 3 4) := by
  intro h
  obtain ⟨a, hne, hlt⟩ := res_lt_of_hnRefine_wordAssn
    (F := junkCell "x" ∗ hnCtxt arrayAssn [1, 2, 3] "A" ∗ gFrame)
    h (mopBinop_gate .add 3 4) (irSTATE_cong (by rw [gPre]; ac_rfl) gPre_holds)
  by_cases ha : a = Imp.Bop.apply .add 3 4
  · rw [Imp.Bop.apply_add] at ha; omega
  · exact hne (NRest.single_of_ne ha _)

/-! ### Controls for §4 (`BRefine`)

The positive control runs a two-op straight-line program all the way to
an `Ir.bpre` witness at a concrete state; the negative one is the same
program at a bound its arithmetic overflows. -/

/-- `x := y + z` then `x := x + z`, at `B = 100`. Two creation sites,
two side conditions, both `by decide`; the frame carries `y` across the
second, and no `Ir.State` predicate is authored anywhere. -/

      (natAssn (Imp.Bop.apply .add (Imp.Bop.apply .add 3 4) 4) "x" ∗ natAssn 4 "z" ∗

    (BRefine.binop_self (op := .add) (x := "x") (z := "z")
      (m := Imp.Bop.apply .add 3 4) (n := 4) (by decide))

/-- **The bounds witness, end to end.** `Ir.bpre` at a concrete state,
with no `Ir.State` invariant authored: the assertion *is* the
invariant. This is what `Codegen/Cash.lean`'s `exists_bigStepB_of_hnRefine`
consumes. -/
theorem brefine_demo_bpre :
    Ir.bpre 100 ((Com.binop .add "x" "y" "z").seq (Com.binop .add "x" "x" "z"))
      (fun _ => True) gState :=

    (irSTATE_cong (by rw [gPreL]; ac_rfl) gPreL_holds) gState_bound

/-- **Refuted at the bound.** The same program at `B = 8`: `3 + 4 = 7`
still fits, `7 + 4 = 11` does not, and `bpre` is false at the second
site — so no `BRefine 8` for this program can exist. -/
theorem no_bpre_at_bound :
    ¬ Ir.bpre 8 ((Com.binop .add "x" "y" "z").seq (Com.binop .add "x" "x" "z"))
      (fun _ => True) gState := by

  rw [Ir.bpre_binop] at h2
  exact absurd (h2 7 4 rfl rfl).1 (by decide)


/-! ### R2/D-c: the pipeline probe

Two `#sepref_synth` runs at `wordAssn`, reported rather than thrown
(`Sepref/Definition.lean`'s negative-control precedent). The first is a
single operation; the second adds a `bindT`, which is what makes
`hnr_bind` abstract the bound value's ownership.

**What they report** (the spike's pipeline telemetry):

1. **One operation synthesizes.** `Com.binop Imp.Bop.add "t" "a" "b"`,
   at `wordAssn` throughout. So the frame matcher has *no* problem with
   `wordAssn`: `hnCtxt (wordAssn B) a "a"` is a single `Expr` atom, and
   `absAgree` pairs it by the abstract value as usual. The P6/D-bc
   composite-assertion opacity does **not** bite, and no wrapper is
   needed. This is the one clean positive result for option (b).

2. **Two operations do not.** Both combinator routes stall on the same
   root cause:

   * `hnr_bind`: *"the bound value's ownership `hnCtxt (wordAssn B) a✝
     "t"` survives the block, and there is no junk form for its
     assertion — the postcondition cannot be closed over the binder"* —
     `Sepref/Translate.lean`'s `junkConjunct`, verbatim;
   * `hnr_seq`: the rule fires and produces the right
     `Com.binop mul "r" "t" "c"`, but the postcondition it proves
     mentions the binder and `?Γ'` cannot be assigned it.

   Fix: two lines in `junkConjunct` (a `wordAssn`/`wordArrayAssn` case),
   or better, replace its constant dispatch by an `MK_FREE`-style
   database lookup. Neither is in this spike's remit (new files only).

An earlier revision of §3 took the operand bounds as rule hypotheses;
the probe then stalled *earlier still*, on `"the side condition was not
closed: a✝¹ < B"`. That is R2/D-e in the flesh: the bound sits in the
assertion, and the side-condition solver cannot read it, because a
side condition is an ordinary Lean goal with no access to the
precondition. Discharging the operand bounds by vacuity instead is what
made probe 1 succeed at all. -/
