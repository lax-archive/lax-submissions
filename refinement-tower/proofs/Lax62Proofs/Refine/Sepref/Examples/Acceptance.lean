P4's acceptance: two abstract programs, written at the user layer,
exchanged into the IR's currencies through `⇓C irE`, and **synthesized**
into deep `Ir.Com` programs by `sepref_synth`.

The campaign plan's P4 criterion is "an abstract program with a loop and
a branch, pushed through the exchange route and turned into a `Com` by
the tool, with the tool's output pinned". This file is two such
programs — one for each half of the criterion, and neither of them a
restatement of a rule:

| program | what it exercises |
|---|---|
| **filter-count** | a branch *inside* a loop body: `hnr_If` under `hnr_while_var`, the `MERGE` of two in-place branch posts, a scratch cell live across the branch, and the `MIf`-to-`irIf` exchange (`timerefine_MIf`, an *equality*) |
| **in-place array reverse** | a mutating loop: the array lives *in the loop state*, `hnr_mop_aset`'s linearity moves its ownership twice per iteration, two scratch cells are consumed and junked inside the body, and the state is a nested `prodAssn` |

Both go the whole way. The chain, per program, is

```
user program (source currencies)
  ──⇓C irE──▶  concrete-layer program (ir currencies)   [exchange, §2]
  ──sepref_synth──▶  Ir.Com                             [synthesis, §3/§4]
  ──hnRefine_ref──▶  hnRefine … (⇓C irE userProg)       [the corollary]
```

and the corollary is the point: the cost bound the synthesized `Com`
carries is a bound on the *user* program's exchanged cost, so a caller
who writes at `''if''`/`''call''` never has to know the IR's currencies.

Not one clause of `∗`-rearrangement is written by hand anywhere below —
see the telemetry block at the end, which is the plan's frame-clause
count.

## Judgment calls (P4/D-ea …)

**P4/D-ea — the user layer's loop is `monadic_WHILEIT`, not
`whileIET`.** The brief names `whileIET`; P1's `whileIET I E b c` is
*definitionally* `whileT b c` (`NREST/Combinators.lean`, the source's own
`whileIET_def`), which charges **no currency at all**. There is therefore
nothing for `⇓C` to exchange at a `whileIET`, and `Sepref/IrOps.lean` §5
proves the loop exchange at `monadicWhileIT` — the combinator that does
pay `cost ''call'' 1` per iteration, which is what `irE` buys at
`ir.while`. So the user-layer loop here is `NRest.monadicWhileIT I
(fun s => returnT (bf s)) g s₀`, the pure-guard instance the exchange
lemma is stated at. Fallback: none needed; `monadicWhileIET I E …` is
`monadicWhileIT I …` by `rfl`, so a caller who wants the energy
annotation writes it and nothing below changes.

**P4/D-eb — only the *structural* currencies are exchanged; the
operations are already at the IR's.** P1's user layer has no array or
scalar operations at all (its `NREST.thy` port is the monad and the
combinators; the `mop_…` layer is ours, `Sepref/IrOps.lean` §1, and by
design record F4 each `mop` is pinned to the IR's own currency). So a
"user program" that is honest about what exists writes the *operations*
at the mop layer and the *control flow* at the source's currencies, and
`⇓C irE` reprices exactly the control flow. Filter-count therefore
exchanges a real `MIf` (`''if''` → `ir.ite`) and a real
`monadicWhileIT` (`''call''` → `ir.while`); reverse, which has no
branch, exchanges only the loop, and its body is a fixed point of the
exchange (§2's per-`mop` invariance lemmas). Fallback when P6's IICF
layer lands with cost-parametric operations: the `ExchOk` calculus of §2
is what a genuinely two-layer program composes through, unchanged.

**P4/D-ec — reverse's destination is the loop state, not the array
cell.** The wave-C handoff expected `d = "A"` with the result assertion
`arrayAssn xs.reverse "A"`. The loop rule forbids it:
`hnr_while_var`'s body judgment is
`hnRefine (hnCtxt Rs s d ∗ Γ) cbody Γ d Rs (f s)` — the frame `Γ` is the
same before and after the body, so *everything the body mutates must be
in `Rs s d`*, and reverse mutates the array. So the loop state is the
triple `(i, j, xs)` at `d = ("i", "j", "A")` with
`Rs = natAssn ×ₐ natAssn ×ₐ arrayAssn`, and the array is its third
component. `rvLoop_array` below then weakens the two index components to
junk through `hnRefine_cons_res`, which *is* the handoff's statement —
`arrayAssn` at `"A"`, with the indices' cells owned but dead. Fallback:
a projection operation (`mop_fst`-style) would let the top-level program
end at the array alone; it is one rule and one `Com.skip`, and nothing
else would change.

**P4/D-ed — the loop invariants carry exactly what the *variant* needs,
and nothing else.** `hnr_mop_aget`/`hnr_mop_aset` discharge their index
bounds internally (`hnr_assert`, Tool.lean's P4/D-cs), so a bound is
never a synthesis obligation; the only consumer of `I` is
`LOOP_VARIANT`, which has to know the body's *value* and so needs the
bounds. Filter-count's guard already implies its bound, so `fcI` is
`True`; reverse's does not, so `rvI s` is `s.1 < s.2.1 → s.2.1 <
s.2.2.length` — an implication rather than a conjunction, so that the
initial state of an *empty* array satisfies it and the theorem is not
vacuous there.

**P4/D-ee — the `else` branch of filter-count is `acc := acc + zero`.**
The mop layer has no in-place no-op: `mopCopy` at `x = y` is the aliased
instance `hnr_mop_copy` is inapplicable at (P4/D-ac), and `mopPair`
cannot deliver a scalar. Both branches must write the same destination
in place for the `MERGE` to be `hnCtxt`-for-`hnCtxt`, so the `else`
branch adds a cell holding `0`. This is what a real compiler emits for a
branch that must leave a register defined, and it keeps the branch
merge honest: the two posts are permutations of one another, which is
what `mergeSolve` reconciles. Fallback: a `mop_skip` at `ir.skip` with
an in-place rule would replace it, at the price of one more rule.

/-! ## 1. Refute before prove

Both abstract programs are *executed* before anything is proved about
them, on concrete inputs, through computable twins of their own step and
guard functions. The twins are not independent specifications: `fcBf`,
`fcStep`, `rvBf` and `rvStep` are the very functions the abstract bodies
are proved equal to in §3 and §4 (`fcF_eq`, `rvF_eq`), so a `#guard`
here is a `#guard` about the abstract program.

Three of the guards are deliberately wrong and pinned as errors — the

/-! ## 2. The exchange route (`⇓C irE`)

`Sepref/IrOps.lean` §4–5 supplies the two structural exchange lemmas —
`timerefine_irE_MIf` (an equality) and `irWhileIT_le_timerefine_irE` (a
≤, with a variant). What is missing for a whole *program* is the rest of
the congruence: `⇓C irE` fixes every `mop` (they are already at ir
currencies, and `irE` is the identity there), and it passes through
`bindT` in the useful direction. `ExchOk` packages the three cases so a
program's exchange proof is one term with the program's own shape. -/

Reverse's *first* body step, with its scratch cell omitted. The envelope
names the phase and its priority, the term it could not translate, the
ownership it had, the cell the caller has to add, and — under
`hnr_mop_aget` — the precise conjunct that went unmatched. Run through
`#sepref_synth`, which reports instead of throwing, so the text is
`#guard_msgs`-checkable and no failing declaration is left behind.

(The suggested name in the pool line is `"t2"` rather than `"t1"`:
`freshScratchName` picks a name that occurs *nowhere* in the goal, and
`"t1"` occurs there as the destination. The rule-level report below it
names `junkCell "t1"` exactly.) -/

/-! ## 6. Telemetry (the plan's P4 gate numbers)

* **Authored lines: 323.** Method: `wc -l` is 762; a nesting-aware scan
  classifies 113 lines as blank and 326 as comment (inside a block
  comment or a docstring, or a `--` line), leaving 323 lines of Lean.
  The 34 lines of `#guard_msgs`-pinned tool output in §5 and the five
  pinned `#print axioms` lines sit inside docstrings, so they are in the
  *comment* bucket and are not counted as authored. Of the 323, the
  three abstract loop bodies are 16 lines, the two user-layer loops 4,
  and the two `sepref_synth` invocations 12; the rest is the reusable
  exchange route (§2) and the value and variant lemmas the *variant
  annotation* needs (P4/D-cv's fallback deletes those).

* **Hand-written frame clauses: 0.** Nothing in this file rewrites with
  `sepConj_assoc`, `sepConj_comm`, `ac_rfl` *on assertions*,
  `irSTATE_rot`, `fri`, `hnRefine_pre_perm` or `hnRefine_frame`. The
  `∗`-lists in the `sepref_synth` goals and in
  `fcPre`/`fcFrame`/`rvPre`/`rvFrame` are interface — what the caller
  owns — and every permutation, split and frame that turns them into
  rule instances is inferred. Two things are worth naming rather than
  hiding under the zero. The three `ac_rfl`s below `congr 1` in
  `fcF_eq`/`fcUF_eq`/`rvF_eq` are on **cost sums** (`ECost`, an
  `AddCommMonoid`), not on `∗`. And `rvLoop_array` applies
  `conj_entails_mono` twice: that is a *result-assertion* weakening
  (three conjuncts, weakened in place, no associativity or commutativity
  used) outside the synthesis pipeline, and it is the only `∗`-shaped
  step written by hand in the file.

* **Synthesis wall clock**, differential against the same file with the
  two `sepref_synth` commands removed, warm build,
  `lake env lean` on the single file (baseline 4.7 s):
  `fcLoop` ≈ **2.8 s**, `rvLoop` ≈ **1.8 s**.

* **Axioms.** `#print axioms` is pinned above for `fcLoop`,
  `fcLoop_user`, `rvLoop`, `rvLoop_user` and `rvLoop_array`: all five are
  `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]` and nothing else.

* **Backlog.** (i) That the reverse loop computes `List.reverse` is
  checked on samples (§1), not proved — the proof is a loop-invariant
  argument over `List.set`, and P4's gate is the *synthesis*, not the
  functional correctness of the example. (ii) `ExchOk` and the per-`mop`
  invariance lemmas of §2 belong next to `Sepref/IrOps.lean` §4 once
  that file thaws; they are stated here because they are what a
  *program*, as opposed to a combinator, needs. (iii) `irWhileIT_mono`
  belongs in `Sepref/IrOps.lean` beside `irWhileIT_unfold`. -/
