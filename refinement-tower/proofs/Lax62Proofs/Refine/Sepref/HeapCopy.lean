# The range-copy loop — `dst[0..n) := src[0..n)`

Leaf **P4.5.A.4**, the named gap of the P5.E re-seat (ledger **E34**).
`Iicf/Impl/ArrayListGrow.lean` exhibited growth as `mopAlloc (2·cap)` followed
by an element-wise copy, priced but **not realized**: "its IR realization is a
bounded `while` over two heap ranges, and no such loop rule is landed yet".
This file lands it.

Nothing here is new combinator theory.  `Examples/ArrayFill.lean` already
builds `while i < n do { A[i] := v; i := i + one }` with an exact credit
vector, through `fillPayload` / `fillInv` / `fill_step` / `fill_guard` /
`fill_body_triple` / `fill_exit` / `fill_loop` / `fill_triple`.  The copy loop
is that skeleton with two changes: two `↦ₕ` ranges (A.1) instead of one
whole-name array, and an `aget`+`aset` body instead of a bare `aset`.

## The program, and what it costs

```
while si < se do { t := heap[si]; heap[di] := t; si := si + one; di := di + one }
```

`si` and `di` are **cursors**, not counters: they hold the absolute heap
addresses `sp + j` and `dp + j`, which is exactly the shape A.1's
`haget_triple` / `haset_triple` take their index cell in (judgment call
D-A1c).  There is therefore no separate index cell and no separate `n` cell:
the bound rides in `se`, holding `sp + n`, and the loop is over the source
cursor.  That is one `add` per iteration cheaper than a counter loop, which
would have to recompute `sp + i` and `dp + i` from `i`.

The price, per iteration, is `blitPayload`:

| unit | why |
|---|---|
| `ir.while` | this iteration's guard evaluation |
| `ir.aget` | the read |
| `ir.aset` | the write |
| `ir.add` | bumping `si` |
| `ir.add` | bumping `di` |

and the whole loop costs `blitCost n = ir.while + n • blitPayload`, i.e.

```
(n + 1) · ir.while + n · ir.aget + n · ir.aset + 2n · ir.add
```

`blitCost_eq` states that as an **equation** on the credit vector, and the
leading `ir.while` is the trailing *failed* guard test — wave A's convention
(judgment call D-d of `Syntax.lean`, and `ArrayFill.lean`'s header): a loop
charges one `ir.while` per guard evaluation, so `n` iterations charge `n + 1`.

**This corrects a recorded cost.**  `ArrayListGrow.lean`'s `arlCopyCost n` was
`n • (ir.aget + ir.aset)` — no `ir.while`, no `ir.add`.  That was the cost
function nobody consumed, and therefore the cost function nobody checked: it
is *understated*, in the same way `implHeapSwimCost` / `implHeapSinkCost` were
(ledger **F11**), and by the same mechanism.  The emitted loop's real cost is
derived here from the program and `arlCopyCost` is redefined to be it.  In
particular `arlCopyCost 0` is **not** `0`: an empty copy still evaluates the
guard once and pays one `ir.while`.

## Disjointness (judgment call D-A4a)

The two ranges must not overlap, and the premise that says so is the
**separating conjunction itself**: the precondition owns `sp ↦ₕ xs` *and*
`dp ↦ₕ zs`, and A.1's `ptoH_sepConj_overlap` is the compiled fact that two
overlapping ranges cannot both be owned.  So the triple below carries no
arithmetic side condition like `dp + n ≤ sp ∨ sp + n ≤ dp`; it carries the
ownership, which is strictly stronger (it also rules out sharing a range with
the frame) and is the form every other rule in this tower states.
`blitPre_overlap_false` pins the consequence as a theorem — at overlapping
bases the precondition is `sepFalse`, so the triple is vacuous there rather
than wrong — and `§5` exhibits a *satisfying* state, so it is not vacuous at
the disjoint instance either.

In the growth case the ranges are disjoint by construction: `mopAlloc` carves
the new block out of `avail hp _`, which owns nothing below `hp`
(`avail_owns_nothing_below`), and the live block is below it.

## Touched-only costs

The loop charges the live prefix `n`, never the capacity: `n` is `se - sp`,
supplied by the caller, and nothing in `blitCost` mentions `xs.length` or
`zs.length`.  An `O(capacity)` sweep here would be an `n²` in every consumer
that grows repeatedly.

## Judgment calls

**D-A4a — disjointness is ownership, not arithmetic.**  Above.

**D-A4b — the measure is `(k, v)`: iterations remaining, *and* the temporary's
current value.**  `ArrayFill.lean`'s loop needs no temporary; ours reads into
`t` and writes out of it, so `t`'s value changes every iteration and the
invariant has to say what it is.  Making it existential (`junkCell t`) inside
the invariant would hide a conjunct from the frame inferencer, which matches
conjuncts syntactically.  Instead the measure is `ℕ × Val` with the
well-founded relation `InvImage (·<·) Prod.fst` — `while_triple` takes an
arbitrary `τ` and an arbitrary well-founded `r`, so this costs nothing — and
`t ↦ᵥ v` is an ordinary conjunct.  The existential appears exactly once, in
the *postcondition*, where the exit value is genuinely unknown; `blitPost_eq`
records that it is `junkCell t`, the `Sepref` idiom for a dead temporary.

**D-A4c — the registered rule is a `mop`, not an `irWhileIT`.**  The abstract
side of `hnr_mop_blit` is `mopBlit`, a `consume (returnT …)` — `hnr_mop_alloc`'s
idiom — rather than a loop combinator.  The copy is *atomic at the abstract
level*: a caller who wants the copied list does not want to reason about a
loop, and the ESOP'21 discipline is precisely that the loop is the
implementation.  This also sidesteps the `irWhileIT` invariant hazard recorded
at ledger **E20/E22**: `irWhileIT_of_not_inv` makes a failed invariant equal
`NRest.fail`, the *top* of the order, so strengthening an `irWhileIT`
invariant enlarges the spec and weakens every `hnRefine` beneath it.  There is
no `irWhileIT` here, so there is no invariant to get backwards; the real
invariant is the seam hypothesis `n ≤ xs.length`, `n ≤ zs.length` on the rule.

**D-A4d — registration (ledger E29).**  `hnr_mop_blit` **is** registered in
`sepref_fr_rules`.  A copy loop is loop-interior by nature, so this is the
direction E29 warns about; it is nevertheless right, and safe, because the
program `blitProg` is *closed and allocation-free* — it is a `while` over
`aget`/`aset`/`add` on `heapName` and five caller-supplied cells, and it
neither mentions `hpName` nor contains `allocProg`.  `blitProg_pinned` pins
the emitted term by kernel computation, so synthesis cannot use this rule to
place an allocation inside a loop: there is no allocation in it to place.

/-! ## 4. The mop and the registered rule

`mopBlit` is the abstract copy: return the copied list, pay the loop's exact
price.  There is **no `assert`** — the bounds are ownership facts the caller
already supplies as `sp ↦ₕ xs` and `dp ↦ₕ zs`, exactly as `mopAlloc` has no
assert because the space is ownership (judgment call D-A2). -/

/-- **The abstract copy.**  `mop_array_blit`, at this leaf. -/

/-! ## 5. Gates and negative controls (falsification law, clause 2)

This loop is *authored* — the source's `array_copy` is an LLVM intrinsic, not
a while loop over two `ll_range`s — so it is not exempt.  Four controls, and
each of them bites. -/

/-- **The emitted program, pinned.**  Nothing here is an allocation: no
`hpName`, no `allocProg`, so registering `hnr_mop_blit` cannot let synthesis
place an allocation inside a loop (judgment call D-A4d). -/

/-- **Negative control 1 — overlapping ranges are not derivable.**  The
precondition owns both ranges, so at overlapping bases it is `sepFalse` and
nothing at all can satisfy it.  This is the disjointness premise, and it is
the separating conjunction (judgment call D-A4a). -/

check on the twin is a check on the semantics — and these are the checks that
