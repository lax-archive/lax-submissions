The synthesis command: the port of `thys/sepref/Sepref_Definition.thy`,
and the wave's end-to-end gate.

Source pin as `Sepref/Basic.lean`'s header (`isabelle_llvm_time`
@ `42dd7f5`); the theory was fetched whole (172 lines) and is 40 lines
of `Term_Synth` marker constants plus the three Isar commands
`sepref_definition`, `sepref_def` and `sepref_thm`, all built out of one
ML function `sd_cmd`:

```isabelle
fun sd_cmd ((((name,attribs_def),attribs_ref),t_raw),r_raw) lthy = let
    val t = mk_synth_term lthy t_raw r_raw          (* SYNTH f R *)

## Judgment calls

**P4/D-da (superseded by tower-expansion P1.B) — the original command
accepted a written goal; it now also accepts an `hfref` signature.** The
source's user writes
`sepref_definition foo is bar :: nat_assn⇧k →⇩a nat_assn`: a name, an
abstract program and an `hfref` *signature*, out of which `synth_hnrI`
builds the `hn_refine` goal (which argument is destroyed, which
preserved, what the result assertion is). Two things stand in the way of
copying that. First, the signature machinery is `Sepref/Rules.lean`'s
`hfref` plus `prepare_hfref_synth_tac`, which P4/D-cx did not port.
Second, and decisively, P4/D-a made the destination a *cell name* and
P4/D-cn made the scratch pool part of the precondition: an `hfref`
signature says nothing about cell names, so the user has to write the
precondition anyway. So `sepref_synth` takes the `hnRefine` goal with
holes where the source has schematics —

```
sepref_synth chain (a b c : ℕ) :
  hnRefine (junkCell "t" ∗ junkCell "r" ∗ hnCtxt natAssn a "a" ∗ …) _ _ "r" natAssn
    (do x ← mopBinop .add a b; mopBinop .mul x c)
```

— which is exactly `schematic_goal … by sepref` with `_` for `?c` and
`?Γ'`, and is P2's `autoref_synth` shape (its delta O2, whose argument
applies here verbatim). P1.B supplies the signature form without a
second command: `sepref_synth` unfolds an `hfref` target's generic
concrete-name, abstract-argument, and precondition binders, runs the
same pipeline on the exposed `hnRefine`, and packages the proof back
into the signature. Named scratch ownership remains explicit in the
signature's input assertion rather than hidden in metaprogram state.

**P4/D-db — `sepref_thm` is the `noDef` flag.** The source has three
commands differing only in what they *add*: `sepref_definition` (theorem
+ definition + attributes), `sepref_def` (the same with default
attributes) and `sepref_thm` (theorem only). Here one command with a
`(thm_only)` flag, because the attribute defaults the other two differ in
(`[llvm_code]`, `[sepref_fr_rules]`) have no counterpart — `llvm_code`
is the source's code generator's tag, and adding the synthesized rule to
`sepref_fr_rules` is `attribute [sepref_fr_rules] name` on the next
line.

**P4/D-dc — the `Term_Synth` markers are not ported.** `SYNTH`,
`CP_UNCURRY`, `CP_PAT`, `INTRO_KD`, `SPEC_RES_ASSN`, `hfunspec`,
`UNSPEC` and the `synth_hnrI` rule exist to *derive* the goal from the
signature by resolution inside Isabelle's `Term_Synth` framework. Lean's
P1.B frontend performs that bounded derivation directly by unfolding the
transparent `hfref` judgment; it does not reproduce a general term-synthesis
engine. `SYNTH` remains the marker naming the intent.

/-! ### Smoke synthesis 1 — a straight-line program

Two chained binops, `t := a + b; r := t * c`. The abstract program is
written at the mop layer (`Sepref/IrOps.lean`); the precondition owns
the three argument cells and two scratch cells, one of which is the
destination. -/

sepref_synth chain (a b c : ℕ) :
  hnRefine (junkCell "t" ∗ junkCell "r" ∗ hnCtxt natAssn a "a" ∗ hnCtxt natAssn b "b" ∗
      hnCtxt natAssn c "c")
    _ _ "r" natAssn
    (NRest.bindT (mopBinop .add a b) fun x => mopBinop .mul x c)

#guard chain_impl =
  Com.seq (Com.binop Imp.Bop.add "t" "a" "b") (Com.binop Imp.Bop.mul "r" "t" "c")

/-! ### Smoke synthesis 2 — a branch

`if m < n then r := 1 else r := 2`. Both branches write the same
destination, so the merge is `MERGE_triv`; the guard is the fused
`CondRefine` of P4/D-af, and the `.lt` condition is *synthesized* from
the abstract `decide (m < n)`. -/

sepref_synth branch (m n : ℕ) :
  hnRefine (junkCell "r" ∗ hnCtxt natAssn m "m" ∗ hnCtxt natAssn n "n")
    _ _ "r" natAssn
    (irIf (decide (m < n)) (mopConstN 1) (mopConstN 2))

#guard branch_impl =
  Com.ite (Cond.lt (Operand.cell "m") (Operand.cell "n"))
    (Com.const "r" 1) (Com.const "r" 2)

/-! ### Smoke synthesis 3 — the array pair

`t := A[i]; A[i] := t`. The linearity showcase: `hnr_mop_aset` moves the
array's ownership into the result slot, and the scratch cell it used is
junk in the postcondition. -/

/-! ### The `sepref` *tactic*, on a schematic goal

The command is the usual entry point, but the source's is a method, and
so is ours. A Lean goal cannot be schematic in its statement, so the
schematic form is an existential — P2's `Autoref/Tool.lean` delta O2
again — and `sepref` fills both holes. -/

/-! ### Smoke synthesis 4 — a tuple-state loop (P4/D-cu, P4/D-cv)

The wave's hardest integration test, and it lands: the sum of the first
`n` naturals, as a loop whose state is the pair `(i, acc)` living in the
two cells `"i"` and `"acc"`. Three pieces of wave-C machinery meet here.
The loop rule sees the state as *one* conjunct
(`hnCtxt (natAssn ×ₐ natAssn) s ("i","acc")`); the body's two in-place
`binop`s see it as *two* (`hnCtxt natAssn s.1 "i"` and
`hnCtxt natAssn s.2 "acc"`), which is `frameMatch`'s split retry; and the
body's last step rebuilds the tuple with `mopPair`, which compiles to
`skip`. The variant comes from the caller, as `LOOP_VARIANT`. -/

`sumLoop` above takes `hv : LOOP_VARIANT …` because P4/D-cv's loop rule
demanded a variant. It does not any more: `CombRules.lean`'s `hnr_while`
reads termination off the abstract loop's own non-failure
(`loopTerm_of_nofailT`), and it is the `sepref_comb_rules` entry.

So the annotation goes away with nothing put in its place — same goal,

/-! #### 3 — a `check_EVAL` leftover

An `EVAL` tag that survives the combinator step never reaches `trans`:
wave B2's own sub-phase reports it, by name and priority, and the
driver's envelope does not wrap it twice. -/

info: sepref: phase 'check_EVAL' (priority 40) failed.
an `EVAL` tag survived the combinator phase:
  Lax62Proofs.Refine.Sepref.EVAL $ᵃ fun y =>
    Lax62Proofs.Refine.Sepref.PROTECT2 (HAdd.hAdd $ᵃ y $ᵃ Lax62Proofs.Refine.Sepref.PR_CONST 1)
      Lax62Proofs.Refine.Sepref.DUMMY
no `sepref_monadify_comb` equation applies to it.
Either the operation needs a combinator equation, or the tagged
application's head is an abstraction (the source's
`monadify: higher-order`), which this phase cannot flatten.
