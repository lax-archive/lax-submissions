The costed bump allocator, `free`, and their registered refinement rules.

Leaves **P4.5.A.2** and **P4.5.A.3** of
`plans/word-ram/tower-expansion/p4.5-design.md` (decision **D-A2**,
ledger **E24**), on top of A.1's range ownership.

Source pin `isabelle_llvm_time` @ `42dd7f5`,
`thys/sepref/Hnr_Primitives_Experiment.thy` (design note §3A):

```isabelle
mop_oarray_new n = consume (RETURNT (replicate n None)) (lift_acost (cost'_narray_new n))
lemma hnr_eoarray_new'[sepref_fr_rules]:
  "(narrayo_new TYPE('a), mop_oarray_new) ∈ snat_assn^k →⇩a (eoarray_assn A)"
```

Two things port verbatim and one deviates.

*Verbatim.* The **shape**: the abstract value is the list, the concrete
value is the **base pointer**, and the assertion (`eoarray_assn` there,
`heapBlockAssn` here) relates them; and the **unconditionality** — the
size argument is *kept* (`snat_assn⇧k`, `hnCtxt` on both sides) and there
is no `ASSERT` beyond the source's tagging no-op. `mopAlloc` below has no
`assert` either, which is the property the whole phase exists to
reproduce.

*Deviating.* The **cost**, ledger **E24**. The source pays
`cost ''malloc'' n`, because a real LLVM `malloc` costs proportionally to
the block it hands back. Ours is `irUnit copy + irUnit add` — two IR
steps, *independent of `n`*. That is a **substrate** deviation, not an
optimisation: `Lax13/Ram.lean`'s cells already exist and already hold
zero (`Imp.lean:305`, "an array costs nothing, since the machine's memory
starts zeroed"), so we are not doing the source's work faster, we are on
a machine where that work does not exist. `allocCost` is a function of
the block size that does not mention it, and §4's controls fail if a
linear term ever creeps in.

At this leaf the element layer does not exist yet (that is B), so the
abstract value is the zero-filled list rather than the `None`-filled one.

## A.3 — the E23 correction, and what it buys

Ledger **E23** gave two reasons for excluding deallocation. The second
still holds; **the first does not, and A.2 is what showed it.** E23 said
the O(1) allocation is bought by never reusing memory. What it is
actually bought by is the handed-out region being *known to read zero*,
and `avail` carries that knowledge **in the assertion** rather than
deriving it from "never touched". Non-reuse is only how zeroness is
established at entry. Since `lo_init` says an all-`None` EO array owns no
element memory whatever the concrete contents, leaf B's arrays need no
zeroed backing at all, so for them reuse is free rather than O(n).

So there are two availability flavours — `avail` (zeroed) and `availRaw`
(contents unspecified) — with `avail_entails_availRaw` one way and **no
theorem the other way**, because restoring zeroness is O(n).
`availRaw_not_entails_avail` states that boundary rather than leaving it
as an absence. Consequently:

* O(1) **zeroed** allocation is untouched — `alloc_triple`, `alloc_rule`
  and `hnr_mop_alloc` keep their exact statements, so E24's headline and
  the n² dissolution are undisturbed;
* O(1) **raw** allocation is available (`hnr_mop_allocRaw`), which is
  what leaf B will want;
* O(1) **reuse** is available (`free_allocRaw_reuse`);
* a **zeroed** block out of reused memory in O(1) is *not* available, and
  nothing here should look as though it were.

`allocGen_triple` is why the two flavours cost the same: the allocator
never reads or writes the heap, so the space assertion rides through as a
frame and both flavours are instances of one triple.

## The design point: ownership, not a precondition (D-A2)

An allocator cannot conjure ownership. The naive way to arrange it is a
side condition like `hp + n ≤ limit`, which would put conditionality back
on the operation and defeat the phase. Instead the unallocated space is a
**resource in an assertion** — `avail hp k`, owning the bump-pointer cell
and the `k` zero-reading cells above it — and `alloc n` *consumes* `n`
units of it, splitting `[hp, hp + n)` off by A.1's `ptoH_append`. The
abstract operation stays unconditional; what a caller must supply is
ownership, exactly as it must already supply `¤¤` credits, and the frame
rule carries the rest. The rule's precondition is `avail hp (n + k)` for
an arbitrary leftover `k`: that is a decomposition of what the caller
owns, not an inequality the operation imposes.

Two consequences are theorems here, not comments:

* **No reuse is linearity, not an invariant.** `avail_split` *moves*
  `[hp, hp + n)` out of the availability resource, so what is left owns
  nothing below `hp + n` (`avail_owns_nothing_below`) and the same range
  cannot be handed out twice (`alloc_no_reuse`). Nothing is assumed.
* **Zero contents come from the machine, established once.**
  `avail_of_entry` reads the availability resource off an entry state
  whose reserved heap array is `List.replicate m 0` and whose bump cell
  is `0` — which is exactly `Imp.initEnv`'s shape (`vars := fun _ => 0`,
  `arrs := fun a => List.replicate (ext a) 0`). It is discharged once,
  at entry, and never re-proved per call.

## Exhaustion is global, and is not restated here (D-A3)

The program-level condition already exists: `Layout.FitsWords B w`
(`Compile.lean`), whose `span` clause is `L.span B ≤ 2 ^ w` with
`L.span B = L.temps + 2 + L.scalars.length + L.arrays.length * B`, and the
array lengths are existential per input (`Codegen/Cash.lean:389`,
`solves_of_spec`). **This file authors no second exhaustion condition** —
a per-operation copy is precisely the rule-5 violation the phase exists
to remove. The relation is *recorded* instead: the availability resource
has size `m`, the reserved heap array's length; an index of that array is
addressed at `L.arrAddr heapName i = L.arrBase heapName + L.arrays.length * i`
and `Layout.span` reserves `L.arrays.length * B` for all array cells
together, so `m ≤ B` puts the whole availability resource inside the
span, and `FitsWords.span` then puts it inside `2 ^ w`.

That relation is recorded **here, in prose, and nowhere as a theorem of
this file**. A statement worth proving would have to relate the
availability resource's size to `ext heapName` and thence to `B`, which
puts it at the `Codegen/` boundary where `initEnv` and `Solves` live —
not in a refinement rule, which has no business seeing which layout a
program is compiled under. Nothing below takes a `Layout` argument and
this file does not import `Compile`.

/-! ### Raw availability (A.3)

**The E23 correction.** Ledger E23 said the O(1) allocation is bought by
never reusing memory. That is wrong, and `avail` above is the evidence:
what the O(1) actually needs is that the handed-out region is *known to
read zero*, and that knowledge is carried **in the assertion**, not
derived from "never touched". Non-reuse is merely how zeroness is
established at entry (`avail_of_entry`). Since `lo_init`
(`p4.5-design.md` §3) says an all-`None` EO array owns no element memory
*whatever the concrete contents*, leaf B's arrays do not need zeroed
backing at all — so for them reuse is free rather than O(n).

Hence two flavours, one refining the other:

* **zeroed** — `avail`, above: `k` cells I own, known to read zero;
* **raw** — `availRaw`, here: `k` cells I own, contents unspecified.

`avail_entails_availRaw` is the refinement. **The converse has no
theorem, and must not**: turning raw memory back into zeroed memory costs
one write per cell, so it is O(n), and stating it in O(1) would be
false. `availRaw_not_entails_avail` pins that as a theorem rather than
leaving it as an absence. Fresh memory arrives zeroed from
`Imp.initEnv`; freed memory returns **raw**. -/

/-- `k` cells at `hp` that I own and whose contents are unspecified. The
existential is the source's own device: `nao_assn A xs p` is
`EXS xsi. narray_assn xsi p ** …`, hiding the concrete backing exactly
this way. -/

quantifies the concrete backing — and it is what keeps the abstract

/-! ## 4. `free`, as stack discipline

**What this provides, and what it does not.** `free` is LIFO only: the
block released must be the topmost one. The source frees arbitrary
blocks; we do not, and there is no free list and no fragmentation story
here. What makes it sound is not an arithmetic check but the *shape of
the precondition* — you must own the block `p ↦ₕ xs` **together with the
availability that starts exactly at `p + xs.length`**, so "this block is
on top" is ownership of the adjacent region, in the same way that "there
is room" was ownership in A.2 rather than `hp + n ≤ limit`. A block with
anything still live above it cannot satisfy that precondition
(`free_nontop_false`).

LIFO is a real restriction against the source. It is also exactly the
shape of a recursive per-arena pass, which is what the consumers in this
campaign are; that is a reason it is tolerable, not a reason it is
general.

The block returns to **raw** availability, never to zeroed
(`avail_of_entry` is the only source of zeroness, and it fires once, at
program entry). `free_preserves_heap` is the theorem behind that: `free`
does not write a single heap cell. -/

not mention, exactly as `allocCost` does not. -/

/-- **`free`**, as one existing constructor: `hp := hp - nc`. It is one
instruction where `alloc` is two, and the asymmetry is real rather than
an omission: `alloc` must both *read* the old bump pointer (that is its
result) and advance it, while `free` returns nothing and so only has to
move the pointer back. No new `Ir.Com` constructor either. -/
def freeProg (nc : String) : Com := Com.binop Imp.Bop.sub hpName hpName nc

/-- **`free`'s exact triple.** Give up the topmost block and the
availability above it; get back availability covering both, raw. There is
no side condition at all: `xs.length` *is* the block's size and the
adjacency is the shape of the precondition. -/

/-! ### What is *not* available, as theorems

`availRaw_not_entails_avail` above already pins that raw memory is not
zeroed memory. Two more, both about `free`. -/

/-- **`free` writes nothing.** It moves the bump pointer and touches no
heap cell, so the freed block still reads whatever it held. This is the
theorem behind "freed memory returns raw, never zeroed": a zeroed
postcondition would have to be false unless the block was already
zero. -/

/-- **A block that is not the topmost one is not freeable.** `free`'s
precondition owns availability of size `k` starting at `p + n`; if some
other block is still live `j < k` cells above the bump pointer, it lies
*inside* that availability, and the two cannot be owned at once. So the
precondition is unsatisfiable exactly when the block is not on top —
enforced by ownership, not by an arithmetic check. -/

allocator. -/
