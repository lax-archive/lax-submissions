# The VCG at the IR's loop, and the cost algebra a linear budget needs

Two pieces of tower that P7 discovered were missing, both stated for any
program and neither about breadth-first search.

## 1. `irWhileIT` meets `While` (P7/T-a)

`Sepref/Translate.lean`'s loop rule synthesizes `irWhileIT I bf f s₀`,
and `NREST/BackwardsReasoning.lean`'s `While` reasons about
`whileIET I E b C s₀`. Nothing connected them, so a program the tool can
translate had no VCG, and a program the VCG can handle could not be
translated.

The two differ in exactly one place. `irWhileIT` asserts its invariant
**before** the guard is tested, so it asserts it once more than
`whileT` does — at the exit state. Where the assertion can fail there,
`irWhileIT` is the *larger* program (a failure is the top of `NRest`),
so no inequality goes the way a `≤ SPEC` proof needs.

`irWhileIT_eq_whileIET` closes the gap by fixing the *shape* of the
invariant: an invariant of the guarded form `bf s = true → P s` is
vacuous exactly where the extra assertion sits, and then the two
programs are **equal**. The guarded form is not a restriction in
practice — it is the form P4's own examples already use (`rvI`, P4/D-ed:
"stated as an implication so that the initial state satisfies it"),
because the only consumer of the invariant is the body, which runs only
when the guard holds.

The `whileIET` side carries a *second* invariant `J` and an energy `E`,
both free: they are the annotations `While` reads off the term, and they
have nothing to do with the assertion the program makes. So a caller
picks the program's `P` for the operation bounds its body needs, and the
proof's `J`/`E` for the correctness argument — which is the right
separation, and the one the source's `whileIET` was designed for.

## 2. Two-currency energies (P7/T-b)

A loop whose budget is linear in two independent sizes carries an
energy `a • A + b • B`. `ACost`'s subtraction is pointwise and
truncated, so the one fact every such argument needs — that the energy
gives up exactly `(a - a') • A + (b - b') • B` — is not `abel`; it is
`Nat.add_mul` and `omega`, once.

/-- **Reading a specification back through a projection (P7/T-c).**
A synthesized program ends at its loop state; the abstract program the
caller specified ends at one *component* of it. The bound transfers
because every result of `m` is a result of the projected bind at its
image: if `x` is affordable at `Ca` in `m`, then `f x` is affordable at
`Ca` in `bindT m (returnT ∘ f)`, and the specification prices that.

Placement (P7/D-bi): this belongs beside `NREST/Pw.lean`'s `bindT`/
`spec` calculus, not in a Sepref file; it is here because the rest of
this campaign's `spec` lemmas are, and the P1 files are frozen. -/
