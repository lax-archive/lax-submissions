# Treewidth contract

This file gives the treewidth interface needed by the polynomial grid-minor
development. It deliberately contains only definitions and axiom-free basic
API; proof-heavy bounds such as the feedback-vertex-set bound belong in full
proof modules.

namespace SimpleGraph

/-- A tree decomposition of a finite simple graph.

The decomposition has a finite tree of nodes, assigns a finite bag of graph
vertices to each node, covers every graph vertex, covers every graph edge in
some bag, and requires the nodes whose bags contain a fixed graph vertex to
induce a connected subgraph of the decomposition tree.

The subtraction is natural-number subtraction, so a decomposition whose largest
bag is empty has width `0`; this convention handles the empty graph without a
separate integer-valued parameter.

This decomposition witnesses the coarse bound `treewidth G ≤ |V| - 1` and, more
importantly, proves that the minimization defining `treewidth` is never empty
for finite graphs.
