# ND-MC rebase plan — the driver stack re-derived through the refinement tower

Rev 2, 2026-07-30. **Status 2026-08-06: ACTIVE on the re-derivation
road. The tower's P4.6 probe completed (its ledger E43/E44): the
member-driven order-phase text synthesizes whole and is carrier-blind,
compiled — so the cost residue is a re-derivation, not a hand repair.
Road: S2/S3 (`driverRootD`/`levelAtR`/`"lw"`, killing slots #6/#26/#12)
→ member-driven engine family (2E/D-a in member form) → `g2_exists`
re-validation (item 4 below) → E-mem member lists into `LevelPre` →
order/cover phases re-synthesized from M-shaped signatures → B7 re-run
→ C0 → P5 draft. The provisional-P5 draft option is withdrawn on this
branch. Direction approved by Jan 2026-07-30 (conversation): fastest
path to the tower-based ND-MC; the old-style cost wave is frozen, not
executed.** JAN-FLAGs 1–3
resolved 2026-07-30 under Jan's delegated supervisor authority
("full authority, may resolve the jan-flags"): all three at their
documented defaults — (1) superseded layer deleted in P5 after G4,
(2) per-engine retention at supervisor discretion with ledger
entries, (3) `wordAssn` thaw pre-authorized on a green spike. This
document is the contract: implementing sessions follow it,
deviations need an owner decision first.

Rev 3, 2026-07-31 (continuation session; Jan: "continue the work on
ndmc, full authority to rework the plan"). The wrap's next-session
entry points are reworked into the **G-road** section below, with
three deltas from the supervisor's critical review of the campaign
record: (1) **G1 is re-scoped to stop before the root restatement** —
the dedup guard lands as proof-side dedup functions + `dedupCom` +
the composed decode Prop (`DecodeImplementsD`), and the
`driverRootD` restatement folds into the B7 re-run, which restates
the root anyway (general `R`, G2 cost forms); landing it twice is
the certain-rework B7 already declined. (2) **Standing rule,
compiled costs both directions**: a cost claim that gates work needs
a compiled witness not only as refutation (floors) but as
*satisfiability* — the closed-form `Kl` witness must be shown to
satisfy the proposed side conditions at the target shape before any
re-thread wave launches. §2.4's prose "yes" died for lack of exactly
this existence probe. (3) **B7 re-run opens with a compiled 30-slot
derivability sweep** from `EncodesGraph` + parameter equations alone
— the two gate findings were both slots earlier ruled fine in prose
(D4's "root input data"; §2.4's verdict), so the remaining "27 had
honest producers" claim is not trusted either until compiled.
Budget honesty: the rebase's 6–10-session envelope is spent (Session
21 alone ran ~35 waves); remaining road is realistically 3–6
sessions (G1 one wave, G2-design one, G2 execution two–three, B7
re-run + P5 one–two). The original campaign forecast (30–48) still
holds; the local envelope did not.

Rev 2 delta (from a parallel supervisor instance's pre-rebase
review, folded in): P0 gains item 5, a **synthesis-scaling probe**
— the only tower cost that compounds over the campaign; BFS
synthesized in 49 s with linear-scan rule matching, and P2 grows
both the rule DBs and the program sizes. One oversized synthetic
program (~3–5× BFS op count) with the full DB loaded, wall-clock
measured; roughly-linear → done, superlinear → DiscrTree-index
`sepref_fr_rules` (and the frame-match conjunct scan if profiled)
**before** the engine waves. `packN` beyond 4 joins the trailing
list, demand-driven. Sequencing nuance made explicit: item 2's
outcome binds P2 brief style, so **P0 must fully land before any
P2 brief is frozen**; P1 may interleave.

**Working model** (unchanged): Fable supervises — plan, sequencing,
review, acceptance calls, commits — and Opus subagents write the Lean.
Refute-before-prove is standing practice for every authored
obligation. Scope is **proofs-only**: no concept surface changes
anywhere (the C0 statement and all Lax3 concepts are untouched), no
`lean-toolchain` or mathlib pin moves. The tower's fidelity charter
(`word-ram/refinement-tower-plan.md`) governs any change made inside
`Lax13Proofs/Refine/`; new deviations there are ledger entries in that
file's style.

## Charter

**Objective: the rebased ND-MC, fastest.** Replace the hand-walked
RAM program layer of `nowhere-dense-model-checking/proofs/Lax3Proofs`
with tower-synthesized programs, discharge C0 on tower-computed costs,
and draft-submit. This is *not* an evaluation campaign: no line gates,
no baseline measurement, no P7-gate-style verdict (Jan, 2026-07-30 —
"I don't care about eval metrics"). Acceptances are green-or-blocked,
nothing else.

**What is frozen and reused (the capital):**

- The math core P0–P4 (`evaluator_decides` and everything under it) —
  untouched.
- The P7 correctness half: `RamDriverRoot.driverRoot_decides_sentence`,
  `driver_correct`, and the named walk-obligation Props are the
  **frozen spec surface**. Tower-synthesized engines discharge the
  *same* obligation Props; the driver assembly proofs are retained,
  not re-derived. (Full-abstract re-derivation of the driver itself is
  out of scope; see JAN-FLAG 2.)
- P6 math (Augmentation/OrderedCovers/AugmentedDensity) — untouched.

**What is superseded:** the old-style cost wave (nd-mc-plan P7 items
(1)–(6)) is not executed. Its items map here as: Kl/Ks recursion → P3
(parametric, survives); touched-only retrofit → free from trail-array
synthesis in P2; tgt couplings → math in P3, walks die with the old
engines; hQ derivation → P3 unchanged; ElimMem repair + bridge
deletion → dies with the old engines; ComputesInTime bridge + C0 →
P4. The old wave spec stays in nd-mc-plan P7 **as the documented
fallback** (see below).

**Where new code lives:** `Lax3Proofs/Refine/` (tower-consumer
layout), namespace `Lax3Proofs.*` throughout per the root lax audit;
the lakefile already requires `Lax13Proofs` + `Lax12Proofs`. Old
`Ram*` files stay in-tree and green until the P4 gate passes — no
engine is deleted before C0 is discharged in tower form.

**Fallback (the hard checkpoint):** if P0 or P1 surfaces a structural
blocker — dependent `hfcomp` is the named candidate — the campaign
stops, the blocker is written up, and the decision to resume the
old-style cost wave goes to Jan. Nothing in P0–P2 makes that fallback
more expensive than it is today.

## Phases

**Checkbox discipline (added 2026-08-02).** These boxes were left unticked
for P1–P3 while the wrap sections and progress log recorded them done, and on
2026-08-02 that inconsistency caused a completed phase to be re-issued to a
worker. The boxes are authoritative for "what is left"; tick them in the same
commit that lands the phase. Current live work is **not** in this list — it is
the G-road below, at the compiled residue (E-mem onward).


- [x] **P0 — tower readiness (1–2 sessions).** **GATE G0 GREEN
  2026-07-30**, all five items (see progress log). All items live in
  `Lax13Proofs/Refine/` (tower campaign is closed; these are its
  handoff/thaw items executed here because this campaign needs them):
  1. **Dependent `hfcomp`** — port it (P2 carry-over, never needed
     until now; ND-MC composition is parameter-dependent everywhere).
     Blocker candidate #1; do it first.
  2. **`wordAssn` spike** (p8-verdict option (b), one session, capped):
     move `<B` into the arithmetic hnr rules; measure on one real
     engine-sized program whether the 560-line bounds class actually
     retires. Outcome binds P2 style: adopt (rule-layer thaw) or
     reject with the telemetry recorded. See JAN-FLAG 3.
  3. **`RECT` fuel-stability export** — retire `LOOP_VARIANT`
     wholesale (verdict: best single ergonomic win; every P2 loop
     pays it otherwise).
  4. **Recursive-arena trail acceptance** — first real touched-only
     consumer: a per-arena pass of `clusterLoad` shape charging
     active-set only, via `treset_cost_touched_only`. This is D5's
     missing exercise and the mechanism C0's time bound stands on.
  5. **Synthesis-scaling probe** (Rev 2): one synthetic program at
     ~3–5× BFS's op count, full rule DB loaded, synthesis wall-clock
     measured against BFS's 49 s. Roughly linear → record and move
     on; superlinear → DiscrTree-index `sepref_fr_rules` (and the
     frame-match conjunct scan if the profile names it) before P2.
  6. (trailing, only if slack) cheap thaw-queue placement/dedupe
     items; `packN` beyond 4 (demand-driven, else first P2 brief
     that hits a wider loop state picks it up).

  **Gate G0:** items 1–5 green → proceed. Any structural blocker →
  fallback checkpoint with Jan.

- [x] **P1 — spec-surface alignment acceptance — GATE G1 GREEN 2026-07-30 (`7e0bd9c`); `Refine/BfsBridge.lean`, 183 code lines, seven bridges B-a…B-g. (½–1 session, may
  interleave with P0).** The tower already re-derived ND-MC's own BFS
  (P7 gate baseline *was* `Lax3Proofs/RamBfs.lean`; export
  `bfsQ_spec`, cost 56n+40ns+33). Swap it in: the driver's BFS-side
  obligations discharged from `bfsQ_spec` instead of the hand-walked
  specs, costs flowing through the parametric slots. **Gate G1:** the
  driver stack builds green with tower BFS underneath, with at most
  thin recorded bridges at the obligation boundary. This validates
  the engines-first architecture end-to-end before any mass work; if
  the bridges come out ugly, that is a shape report and a pause, not
  a push-through.

- [x] **P2 — engine waves — COMPLETE 2026-07-31.** All engines derived, widened and integrated (BFS/Scatter/Elim/Augment-outPass/Cover/order/cluster leaves/expandCom); all 30 hypotheses of `driverRoot_decides_sentence` have named producers. Original text: (2–4 sessions). Re-derive engines
  smallest-first in dependency order: RamScatter + FormulaTables +
  BotEval; RamElim (the tower version supersedes `elimRezeroCom`'s
  bridge pair and the ElimMem conjunct debt outright); RamCover;
  RamAugment (`slotCnt_out_eq` becomes an abstract-level cost fact);
  the ordering phase; the descend/game layer (SplitterWinOracle,
  recorded-batch discipline — NREST's native nondeterminism replaces
  the machine-level existential contortions; the C₄ counterexample
  class dies at this layer). Per engine: abstract NREST program,
  correctness against the frozen obligation Prop, refutation pass
  before proof, synthesis, touched-only cost via trail arrays where
  the pass is per-arena. Satellite discharge files for parallelism;
  single-owner repair waves folding all defect reports at once.
  Per-engine retention escape hatch: see JAN-FLAG 2.

- [x] **P3 — math survivors — COMPLETE 2026-07-31 (math satellite). (1 session; zero program
  contact, runs alongside P0–P2 as a satellite).** (i) Kl/Ks
  recurrence solved **parametrically** in per-engine cost constants —
  never bake in numbers; (ii) `hQ` derived from Lax12's UQW theorem
  (the endorsed axioms enter here, as designed); (iii) the R > 0 tgt
  coupling mathematics (fratSlots/K₁,₄, W vs in-degrees) at the
  abstract level, feeding the cover-degree bound.

- [ ] **P4 — cost assembly + C0 (1 session).** Instantiate the P3
  recurrence with P2's synthesized costs; Spec→`computesInTime`
  bridge; **C0 discharged**, kernel-three, lean_verify'd, root lax
  audit green. **Gate G4:** C0 green → the superseded hand-walked
  engines may be removed per JAN-FLAG 1.

- [ ] **P5 — polish + draft submission (1 session).** abstract.md,
  manifest, plan/NIGHTLOG records, old-layer disposal per FLAG 1,
  draft `lax submit` — **never `--register`** (freeze-consent rule).

Budget: 6–10 sessions end to end; P3 inside the envelope, not added
to it.

## Worker process (every brief, every phase)

Briefs are instantiated from `plans/worker-brief-template.md` (LIVE
2026-07-30; retro evidence in `plans/subagent-retro-2026-07.md`). The
three retro rules that bind hardest here: (1) split at brief time —
any obligation whose honest estimate exceeds one agent-session is
split *before* spawning (the July E1→E1c and B4→B4c chains each burned
three agents on one obligation, ~35% of every spawn re-orienting);
(2) the refutation pass of the P2 recipe is the template's named
falsification-gate section, so it cannot drop out of a brief; (3)
budget check before launching a long wave (a spawn died on the spend
limit 07-29 and cost the wave three hours).

## Traps carried from the tower campaign (into every P2 brief)

From p8-verdict §5: `omega` is blind through the `Ir.Val` abbrev —
bind indices at ℕ; `decide` times out on string-chain arithmetic —
use `decide +kernel`; `split at` on library matches leaks splitters
that only the root `lax` audit catches; scratch cells are consumed
from the precondition in written order; the operator phase never
backtracks across rule choice — order junk cells so junk-destination
rules cannot misfire. Plus ND-MC's own: touched-only charging from
the **first** brief of any per-arena pass (n² kills the headline);
per-depth register names, never save/restore (cost-fatal, A3 finding).

**R = 0 scope ruling (2026-07-30, supervisor, FLAG 2 discretion).**
Wave 2E established that at R = 0 the driver's augmentation fold is
`Com.skip`: the augment round and all counting sorts are dead code
on the C0 path. Consequently **RamAugment is retained old-style**
(its `RamDriverAugment.implements` is consumed by the frozen driver
assembly and stays green); the tower augment passes landed by 2C
(alvSet/prefix/count, plus whatever 2C′ banks) are R>0 capital, not
C0 critical path. The R>0 completion (tgt widening per TgtCoupling,
the round assembly, the sorts) is a future campaign's wave.

**Integration-A findings (2026-07-30, Fable wave — SUPERSEDES the
two ruling blocks below in part; full record in
`integration-design.md`).** (F1) The frozen driver *program* is
Ω(n^ℓ) in its text (n centre turns per level unconditional, inner
recursion unconditional — compiled floor theorem
`uniform_interface_floor_zero` in `Refine/CostShapeProbe.lean`);
the Σ-revision therefore includes the R1 program-skeleton change
(compacted centre loop, block-driven zeroing) — supervisor
decision D-1 APPROVED. (F2) At R = 0 there is no cover-degree mass
bound (`exists_cover_degree` needs 3t ≤ R; cap ≥ 9), so C0's cost
path runs at `R* = 3⌈log₂(2·cap)⌉` — the augment rounds, counting
sorts, and the tgt widening are LOAD-BEARING after all (the R=0
ruling below stands for correctness only; the 2C/2C′ augment
capital returns to the critical path); supervisor decision D-2
option (a) APPROVED. Positive: the size-indexed interface + R1
lands the recurrence in `CostRecurrence.solve` at coefficient D+1
→ n^{1+ε} confirmed (paper + compiled star probe). Road: briefs
B1–B7 in integration-design.md §8.

**Σ-shape cost threading (2026-07-30, supervisor analysis — binds
the integration wave and P4).** The frozen driver cost interface is
uniform-per-turn: `hKl`'s `(Ks j + 8) * n` charges the max cluster
cost times n turns, which loses exactly the `Σ|X_c|` saving the
touched-only engines produce (star-like instance: uniform×n = n²,
true sum linear — C0's almost-linear bound is underivable through
the uniform shape). This is the old plan's "touched-only retrofit
is LOAD-BEARING; the recursion as stated is n^ℓ" item surfacing at
the driver layer: the rebase's engine costs are touched-only for
free, but the DRIVER's cluster-loop threading must be revised to
per-turn costs summed (Σ-shape) — a proofs-side hypothesis revision
of `levelImplements`/`driver_correct`/`driverRoot_decides_sentence`
(the C0 concept statement is untouched; P3's CostRecurrence solver
is parametric and absorbs either shape). Scheduled into the
integration wave; ledger entry required there.

## G-road (rev 3 — the P4 repair legs, contract for the remaining sessions)

Sequencing: **G1 ∥ G2-design** (disjoint files, same worktree; lake
lock contention is the template's wait-and-retry) → **G2 execution**
→ **B7 re-run** → **P5**.

Model allocation (Jan, 2026-07-31 in session: "more fable over opus
for the harder parts"): **Fable** on the waves where authored-surface
subtlety and cross-file integration dominate — G2-design (done), E2,
E6, and the B7 re-run; **Opus** on template-shaped waves — G1a/G1b,
E1, E3, E4, E5. Always fresh agents with a template brief, never
forks ([[fable-subagents-no-fork]]). The fallback clause stands: a structural
blocker in G2 goes to Jan with a write-up, noting the frozen
old-style wave is *dominated* (inherits both floors), so the honest
fallback there is a weaker headline (cost bound at a worse exponent)
or the R1+R2 citable-core draft, not the old wave.

- **G1 — dedup guard (one Opus wave).** Proof-side dedup of the
  encoding (`dedupOffset`/`dedupTarget`/`dedupNs` on words, with
  `CsrGraph` preserved, `CsrSimple` by construction, `ns' ≤ ns`,
  zero tail above `ns'`); `dedupCom` (mark/collect/unmark per row —
  mark array + trail discipline, cost `O(n + ns)`);
  `DecodeImplementsD` = the composed `.seq decodeCom dedupCom` Spec
  with `DecodeImplements`'s postcondition template at the dedup'd
  data. Differential gates: `C0Probe.dupWord` end-to-end (row
  compacts, tail zeroed, `CsrSimple` holds); refute "dedup preserves
  `ns`". STOPS before any root restatement (rev 3 delta 1). New slots
  `hcsr`/`hpad0`/`hO`/`hT`/`hns` die at the B7 re-run, discharged
  from the dedup lemmas.
- **G2-design (one Fable wave, compiled).** The arena-charged phase
  interface: `hKo`/`hKc`/`hKd`/`hKbase` re-threaded to size-read
  forms (R1.6/R1.8 finally in the *cost surface*), live-width
  save/restore, degree-aware `chainWidth` (the `n·n` term dies
  against `arcs_le`/`AugmentedDepthOneDensity`; `W` re-enters at
  `O(n·budget²)`). Deliverables: a design doc (§5-style old→new
  table + wave decomposition) and a probe file with (a) the
  **existence probe** — a closed-form `Kl` shown to satisfy every
  proposed side condition, recurrence closing to the `(D+1)^ℓ`
  shape with the root `W`-term (decode + one save/restore at live
  width + dedup) inside `n^{1+ε}`; (b) floor-death checks — the
  `C0Probe` floor derivations demonstrably fail against the new
  forms; (c) negative controls in the CostShapeProbe style. No
  frozen-surface edits; design only.
- **G2 execution (two–three waves, per G2-design's decomposition).**
  Expected shape: engine-side block-driven order/cover/base variants
  (tower re-derivations), the interface re-thread through
  `levelImplements`/`levelAt`/`levelCost_of_sigma`, the
  `orderImplementsR` re-discharge at the new cost form, `chainWidth`
  revision threaded through `TgtCoupling`/`hWc`. Single owner per
  induction; satellites for leaves; refutation gates per the
  template.
- **B7 re-run (one wave).** Opens with the compiled 30-slot (now
  ~26-slot) derivability sweep (rev 3 delta 3); then `levelAtR` /
  the general-`R` root restatement on the composed decode
  (`driverRootD`), `Spec`→`ComputesInTime` bridge (incl. the
  precondition-memory prologue story), **C0 discharged**,
  kernel-three, `lean_verify`, root lax audit. Gate G4 as before.
- **P5 — polish + draft submission** as specced, incl. FLAG-1
  disposal.

## JAN-FLAGs

1. **Disposal of the superseded layer.** After G4, the hand-walked
   engine/walk files (~15k lines, incl. `RamDriverAugment`) are dead
   weight in the build. Default: delete in P5 — git history keeps
   them, the draft archive shrinks, the build gets faster. Flag
   because it removes landed proofs; alternative is freezing them
   out of the build tree.
2. **Per-engine retention.** Both stacks export the same `Spec`
   interface, so any engine whose re-derivation turns out
   disproportionate can keep its old-style export (verdict option
   (c)). Default: supervisor discretion with a ledger entry +
   review at the next boundary. Flag if Jan wants totality forced
   (north-star purity) or wants specific engines pre-designated.
3. **`wordAssn` thaw pre-authorization.** The spike, if green,
   implies a rule-layer thaw inside the closed tower campaign's P4
   layer. Default: pre-authorized on a green spike, recorded as a
   tower ledger entry. Flag if Jan wants sign-off between spike and
   thaw instead.

## Records

Progress log appended below per session, tower-plan style; NIGHTLOG
entries per overnight session; memory updated at boundaries. The
old-style cost wave remains specced verbatim in nd-mc-plan P7 —
that text is the fallback contract and is not edited beyond a
supersession pointer.

## Session wrap 2026-07-31 (Jan: "wrap up here")

State at wrap (branch `worktree-ndmc-rebase-p0` @ 2bab5b8, landed
on main; every commit green, kernel-three, lax-audit-clean):

- **DONE**: P0 (G0 green, five items), P1 (G1 green), P2 (all
  engines derived, widened, and integrated: BFS/Scatter/Elim/
  Augment-outPass/Cover/order/cluster leaves/expandCom; two tool
  waves T1+T2; the R1 compacted skeleton; the Σ/size cost
  interface; the dead-vertex path; the tgt widening end-to-end;
  symCom + the R\* fold `orderImplementsR` — all 30 hypotheses of
  `driverRoot_decides_sentence` have named producers), P3 (math
  satellite).
- **OPEN — P4 (C0)**: wave B7 stopped at the gate with two
  compiled findings (`Lax3Proofs/C0Probe.lean`): (#1)
  `EncodesGraph` permits repeated targets ⇒ `CsrSimple`
  underivable at the C0 boundary — repair = the G1 dedup-guard
  wave (specced, splice point identified); (#2) an Ω(n·W) floor
  from `hKo`/`hKc`/`hKd`/`hKbase` verbatim — the per-level PHASE
  costs are carrier-width while the C0 path pins W ≥ n²+1 (60n³
  floor compiled). Repair = the G2 phase-cost leg: arena-charged
  phase forms wiring the landed-but-unwired capital (BlockLeaves,
  BfsQTrail, aliveMass) + live-width save/restore + degree-aware
  chainWidth; design brief written (the G2-design wave was
  launched and stopped at wrap — re-issue its brief verbatim from
  the session log to resume). The fallback (old cost wave) is
  dominated — it inherits the same floors.
- **Next session starts at**: G1 (independent, fully specced) ∥
  G2-design (Fable; the accounting must be COMPILED this time —
  §2.4's prose verdict was wrong once), then G2 execution, the B7
  re-run (its brief + the F-c-5 hdeg composition + the 30-slot
  table are in the log below), then P5.

## Session wrap 2026-07-31 evening (Jan: "cancel the current wave and
wrap up here")

State at wrap (branch `worktree-ndmc-rebase-p0` @ 10e6dc4, landed on
main; every commit green, kernel-three, lax-audit-clean; 13 waves this
session, per-wave ledgers in the commit messages e5e0f91..10e6dc4):

- **DONE this session**: plan rev 3 + model allocation; **G1 complete**
  (dedup guard end-to-end, `decodeImplementsD`, `CsrSimple` at the C0
  boundary, cost `31n+50ns+29`); **G2-design** (arena-weight interface
  compiled both directions, E1–E6 decomposition, slot audit); **E5**
  (MassWeight), **E1** (W-free uniform text — C0's ∃p-before-∀n closed
  by signature; `widthCom` producer unspliced, B7 seam), **E2/E2b**
  (`chainWidthE`, live-prefix copies with the compiled clock
  differential, `OrderImplementsRL`), **E3a/E4a/E4b** (block-driven
  cover leaves, touched-only BFS "queue is the trail", active-set
  scatter + `atomCostA` bridges), **E6** (arena-weight re-thread spine,
  root cost `Kl 0 (n+ns)`, `g2_plug` + six gap theorems = the compiled
  residue), **E-order** (no-escape theorem: any empty-arena carrier
  charge breaks the closed form; NO member list exists in driver state
  — R1.6 unbuilt).
- **OPEN — the compiled residue**, enumerated in `Refine/G2CostProbe.lean`
  §7 and **ordered by measured cost since 2026-08-08** by
  `Refine/C0CloseProbe.lean`, which ran the M-class close at each phase's
  own measured constant and back-solved a coefficient ceiling per phase.
  E-mem (member-list threading) and R1.8 (dead-sweep discipline) have
  landed. The order is now by what the numbers say is binding, not by
  engine family.

  **The one-line shape of what is left (added 2026-08-08).** The G2 leg
  built a block-driven engine for **every** carrier-charged phase and the
  campaign has been *wiring them one at a time*. `Refine/ScatterBlock*` was
  wired at R1.8-T3-flip (c1) and its cost closed over the E4c/b4 waves.
  Three remain landed-but-unwired, each named as the missing engine in its
  own `G2CostProbe` §7 ledger row: **`Refine/BlockLeaves.lean`** for the
  descent (`hKs`), **`Refine/CoverBlock.lean`** for the cover (`hKc`,
  referenced today only by `ArenaSeam` and `BfsBlockCost`), and the
  member-driven order text for `hKo`. Read the residue that way and the
  numbered list below is the wiring order plus the interface tidy-ups;
  "landed but unwired capital (BlockLeaves, BfsQTrail, aliveMass)" was
  already the 2026-07-31 wrap's phrase for it, and only `aliveMass` has
  since been consumed.

  1. **E4c, the scatter half — the only unbounded deficit, and the road's
     live leaf.** At the root's own instantiation the per-atom charge was
     `≥ 131·n` (`C0CloseProbe.deadAtomK_carrier_floor`), because
     `ScatterDeadPass.ballBudget_carrier` supplies the whole carrier as the
     ball budget (`bw := ns`, `nb := n`, `mm1 = mm = n`), and no constant
     `ksc` exists (`landed_scatter_leaf_unbounded`) — the single obstruction
     that would kill the road. **e4c-a** (accounting), **e4c-b/c**
     (the mask copy deleted at its source), **e4c-d** (design: the capped
     scan holds, the private array refutes), **b4-design** and
     **b4-walk-1** (every quantity but one read at the turn's cluster) have
     landed; what is left of the carrier in the per-atom charge is the
     distance fill's `11·n + 6` **alone**, which is program text.

     Its removal is **not the hoist** e4c-d §6b priced (private array,
     `ScatterStep` conjunct, sup sentinel, four driver files). The engine
     never reads an unmasked distance cell — `RamBfs.scanSlot` tests the
     mask before reading `dist[w]`, `expandRow`/`unwindSlot` read only at
     queue entries, which `Frontier.qmem` pins alive — so the whole-array
     contract clause is stronger than the program needs, and the fill
     shrinks to a member walk instead of moving. Three waves:
     **2m-1** (landed: the engine's contract at `DistClean`, the arena
     seam, both e4c-d obstructions compiled positively — the landed `sound`
     at a dead vertex is *false*, not merely unprovable), **2m-2** (the
     active-set pass re-walked at `ArenaAM`, `step_run` at
     `bfsBlockM_specW`), **2m-3** (the atom swap: `fillCom "dist"` →
     `ScatterDeadPass.distMemCom`, `11·n + 6` → `memFillAtCost mm1 =
     14·mm1 + 6`, carrier-free, and the charge chain up to the root's
     closed form). E4c-d's §7 capped-scan capital is **not consumed** by
     this route; it was bought for the hoist.
  1b. **E4c, the descend half — the `BlockLeaves` Com-level swap, and it
     was missing from this list until 2026-08-08.** `hKs` is one slot with
     **two** unlanded halves, and only the scatter one was on the road.
     `RamDriverDescend.descendCost = 24·(n·n) + 98·n + 61 + ballCost +
     batchCost` is live in `descendStep` — a **quadratic carrier** charge,
     the largest single term in `turnCost` — while `Refine/BlockLeaves.lean`
     (wave B4c) already holds the block-driven replacements for exactly
     those passes at `15·m₁ + 15·m + 30`, `25·m + 4`, `29·m + 4`,
     `50·m + 30·d + 4`, none of which mentions `n`. **They are referenced
     by no driver file** — only by the cost probes (`MassWeight`,
     `G2CostProbe`, `C0CloseProbe`, `B4Design`). So the engine exists,
     its constant is measured (`C0CloseProbe.ctTurn = KillListPass.ctKL`,
     `443` against a ceiling of `8 788 641`, ×10⁴ of margin), and what is
     missing is the swap into the driver's descent — `G2CostProbe` §7's
     `hKs` row says so in as many words ("`BlockLeaves` Com-level swap into
     `descendCom` + `scatBlockCom` into the turn"), and the second half of
     that row landed at R1.8-T3-flip (c1) while the first never did.
     Unlike the scatter leaf this is **not a deficit** — a constant exists
     and is measured — but `hKs` cannot close without it, so B7/C0 would
     otherwise be reached with a quadratic term still in the turn.

     **Size it honestly: this is an engine wave, not a swap.** The `24·n²`
     is the smaller half. `RamDriverDescend.ballCost n ns cap =
     ((24·ns + 44)·n + 6)·(2·cap) + 11·n + 12` is `O(n·ns·cap)` per turn,
     and `batchCost = ancestorCost n ns cap · j + 26·n + 16` is the same
     shape per earlier round — the descent computes the turn's cluster by
     walking the **carrier** once per expansion round. The block-driven
     replacement is `BlockLeaves`' `bexpPass` (`50·m + 30·d + 4`) run
     `2·cap` times, which fits `ctBlockLeaves = 200·(s + ds + 1)` because
     `cap` is a formula parameter — so the target is coherent, and the work
     is re-walking `ballCom_spec` and `batchCom_spec` at block scale.
     Budget it like the scatter leaf, not like `hKd`. The status "landed
     but unwired capital (BlockLeaves, BfsQTrail, aliveMass)" was recorded
     in the 2026-07-31 wrap as part of the G2 leg; the engines landed and
     the wiring was never scheduled.
  2. **T4b — build a member-driven base**, not measure the existing one.
     `landed_base_needs_carrier_Cb` refutes every constant `Cb`: the landed
     base is `DeadSweep.baseCost = sweepCost` since T4a and is quantified
     over every arena weight including `0`, so `Cb ≥ 4·n+6`. **LANDED**
     2026-08-08: `hKbase` is the campaign's first gap slot closed, and
     `g2_plug`'s implication list drops from five carrier dominations to
     four.
  3. **The `hKd` slot deletion** — cheapest of the three, a statement
     deletion rather than engine work: `(c2b)` took `sweepCom` out of the
     program but `RamDriverRoot.levelAt` still reserves the slot
     (`hKd`, `RamDriverRoot.lean:769`), knowingly vestigial
     (`:789`, `RamDriverCluster.lean:1630`), and
     `landed_hKd_load_bearing` shows the un-narrowed slot forces `Ω(n²)`.
     **STILL OPEN** — it was scheduled into e4c-b, whose Part B dead-ended,
     so it was never done. It restates the same consumers as b4-iface
     (`levelAt`, `levelCost_of_sigma`, `driverRoot_decides_sentence(_binj)`,
     `levelImplements`' Σ summand), so it lands with that wave.
  4. **E3b** (cover composition + the `OrdersBy` contract at members) and
     **E-order** (member-driven order text + walk) — **cost-slack**, four to
     five orders of headroom each (`kc = 150` against a `ka` ceiling of
     `3.95·10⁷`; `68·m + 12` against `7.9·10⁷`). Still required on the
     *walk* side to close `hKc`/`hKo` in the §7 gap ledger, but neither is
     what the budget is waiting for. `GapsDesign.shared_contract_seam`
     makes them **one wave, not two**: a single junk-off-the-members
     condition refutes `RamCover.OrdersBy` and `CoverOut.asg_lt` at once,
     so any wave restating one contract at the members restates the other.
  5. **b4-iface** (the size-read `turnCostSize` slot filled with
     `G2CostProbe.turnCostSizeA`, the `hbnd`/`hcostI`/`hKsc` chain made
     families of the block reading, `RamDriverRoot.scatterBnd_cluster`
     deleted, `hKd` with it) → **B7 re-run** (slot sweep first) → **C0** →
     **P5**. `ScatterDeadTurn.deadAtomKX_block_unbounded` fixes where the
     block reading may live: strictly below `clusterStepAt`, and nothing
     block-scale may touch `Ksc`.

  **Two corrections to the cost surface's own reading**, both compiled in
  `C0CloseProbe`. `rootBudgetM`'s constant is not `D`-free — `g2M` carries
  `(ct+ksc+3)·(D+1)` and the cover slot `162·D` — so the honest exponent
  budget is `ℓ+1` and the cover degree is read at `⌈c·w^{ε/(ℓ+1)}⌉`
  (`rootBudgetM_le_cstar`). And the cover phase does not fit the M-class
  slot at the natural `(a,b)` split (`cover_measured_pair_insufficient`);
  its slot pair is forced to `(kcov, kcov)`.

  **Guards must be read at ε < 1.** Every pre-2026-08-08 gate was at
  ε = 1, where a quadratic cost fits an `n²` budget — which is exactly why
  the carrier-charged scatter leaf survived every earlier check. The
  binding gate is ε = 1/2.

  **E-mem stays a cost repair.** A supervisor retarget on 2026-08-02 briefly
  made it a prerequisite for existence as well; that was wrong and the
  correction is recorded under "Arena width" below. Finding 3 is repaired by
  a *value*-bound change (`ArenaWidth`, landed), not by changing the
  membership representation, so E-mem is once again about cost only:
  `RamCover.coverCost = 100n² + 50n·ns + …`, `coverSaveCost`'s `12(n*n)`,
  the cluster load's `16(n*n)`, and the per-centre carrier walk in the
  emission scan. The `WordBoundK` threading W1–W3 has landed; the
  prerequisites now ahead of E-mem are the tower campaign's **P4.6
  synthesis probe** and the **`g2_exists` re-validation** (items 3 and 4 of
  "What remains before C0" below).
- **Supervisor recommendation (1) — EXECUTED 2026-08-02, and it found a
  third boundary fact.** `Refine/BridgeSeamProbe.lean` (632 lines, 45
  declarations, compiled). See "Seam probe findings" below. Recommendation
  (2) — optional provisional P5, draft-submitting the citable core with C0
  carried as an open obligation — remains open and is now *more* attractive,
  because finding 3 lengthens the road to C0.

## Progress log

- 2026-07-31 — **G-road session (continuation; Jan: full plan-rework
  authority + "more fable for the harder parts")**. Rev 3 landed
  (e5e0f91): G1 re-scoped, compiled-costs-both-directions standing
  rule, sweep-first B7 re-run, budget honesty; model allocation
  pinned (7c63a23). Waves, all green, per-wave ledgers in the commit
  messages: **G1a/G1b** (Opus, 23dd151 + 6e6335d) — dedup guard
  COMPLETE, `decodeImplementsD`, `CsrSimple` at the C0 boundary,
  cost validated+tightened `31n+50ns+29`; finding #1 repaired.
  **G2-design** (Fable, 7cb1b40) — arena-weight interface compiled
  both directions (existence probe `g2_exists` clears the budgets
  where the floor lost); slot audit found TWO MORE carrier sources
  (coverPhaseCost's own 12n², the hbnd→hKsc per-turn chain) and
  three capital-list corrections. **E5** (Opus, 8267f4c) —
  `MassWeight.lean`: weighted descend/mass at the unweighted
  coefficient, `arenaWeight_root = n+ns` (CsrSimple — G1 interlock),
  size-only budgets compiled-refuted. **E1** (Opus, fb213e7) —
  W-free uniform text (`driverRoot q_top cap mb R ℓ φ`), the C0
  ∃p-before-∀n constraint closed by signature; `"lw"` scalar;
  `widthCom` producer landed unspliced (B7 seam). **E2** (Fable,
  a2be151) — `chainWidthE` (n·n term dead, floor route compiled
  dead), capacity re-discharged degree-aware (doc §3(a) prose
  corrected in-wave), symPass tail export, live-width gates.
  **E2b** (Fable, 18b9166) — live-prefix copies end-to-end with a
  compiled clock differential (the 2112-tick gap IS the four
  copies' walk), `OrderMem` bounds pair, `OrderImplementsRL`; one
  frozen Dedup hypothesis repaired+flagged (refutable under the
  pair). **E3a** (Opus, ce02174) — block-driven cover leaves;
  findings: 12n² is an accounting loss not a program delta, `n ≤ m`
  carrier floor forces the alive-prefix copy, NO carrier-free BFS
  existed (capital table wrong). **E4a** (Opus, 8e51cd3) —
  touched-only BFS, queue-is-the-trail, measured carrier-free
  (1076 steps at carriers 100 AND 400). **E4b** (Opus, 01210a0) —
  active-set scatter, `scatBlockK` carrier-free, landed
  postcondition verbatim, `atomCostA` bridge family; BfsBlock
  export gaps found (E6 folds in). **E6** (Fable) launched: slots
  1–5 re-thread + plug check; then B7 re-run (sweep first), P5.
  Root theorems byte-identical kernel-three at every commit; full
  build 3539 jobs, lax OK at 01210a0.

- 2026-07-30 — Rev 1 written; direction approved in conversation
  (rebase-now over ship-then-rederive; no eval gates). No code yet.
- 2026-07-30 — Rev 2: FLAGs 1–3 resolved at defaults under
  delegated authority; scaling probe added as P0 item 5, `packN`
  to trailing, P0-before-P2-briefs sequencing pinned. P0 session
  opens (worktree `ndmc-rebase-p0`, both packages seeded green).
- 2026-07-30 — **P0.1 GREEN** (f8cfa36): dependent `hfcomp` +
  frame-carrying `hnr_comp_dep` + bind-shape consumer test; blocker
  candidate #1 cleared, no structural obstruction. Queued debt: the
  `hrrCompDep` flattening lemma (only bites loop-composition).
- 2026-07-30 — **P3 GREEN, early** (4fb7da2): CostRecurrence
  (parametric solve, closed form, minimality), UqwInstantiation
  (`hQ_of_nowhereDense`, exactly one endorsed Lax12 axiom),
  TgtCoupling (coupling (a) settled negatively — K₁,₄ refutes
  ns-reuse; (b) as single chain-budget width).
- 2026-07-30 — **P0.3 GREEN** (e31be80): the D-cv fuel export
  refuted (compiled counterexample, unbounded nondeterminism);
  correct export is postfixed-point + `LoopTerm` accessibility;
  unfueled `hnr_while` has no termination premise; LOOP_VARIANT
  retired at all 14 loop sites.
- 2026-07-30 — **P0.4 GREEN** (c26318a): recursive-arena trail
  acceptance; nested loop-with-trail synthesized first-try; cost
  signature n-free by construction; compiled proof the naive shape
  admits no touched-only bound. D5 exercised.
- 2026-07-30 — **P0.2 PARTIAL — binds P2 style** (98f26bc):
  `wordAssn` rejected as formally vacuous; **`BRefine`** adopted
  (second judgment component transporting creation-site `<B`
  against the abstract correctness invariant). −28% measured on
  the bounds class, −61% projected with tool support; fully
  additive, FLAG 3 thaw unused. P2 briefs say BRefine.
- 2026-07-30 — **P1 GATE G1 GREEN** (7e0bd9c): tower BFS under the
  driver via Refine/BfsBridge.lean; zero diff at CoverImplements
  and above; six thin bridges P1/B-a..B-g; worked example
  cell-identical. The P2 swap pattern is validated and templated
  (see the P1 report's 7 points, folded into P2 briefs).
- 2026-07-30 — **P0.5 GREEN — probe closes, G0 CLOSED** (probe
  artifact deleted after recording; telemetry here is the record).
  Synthesis scaling on a 16→100-op family, full DB, load-normalized:
  exponent 1.28–1.35 (local ~1.4 in the upper half); 4× ops ≈ 6.2×
  time; 3–5× BFS extrapolates to 45–135 s — minutes, not hours.
  **DiscrTree indexing is the wrong target**: appending 20 rules
  costs ≤2.6%, pre-match scan is a flat ~2 ms/goal (<0.5% at 100
  ops); the growth is the frame/entailment layer (matchLoop/
  proveConjEq walk the conjunct list; one `fri` call = 28% at 100
  ops). Follow-ups if ever needed, payoff order: (1) release dead
  scratch cells mid-block at `hnr_bind` (flattens exponent to ~1);
  (2) cheapen `fri`/`proveConjEq` on long conjunct lists; (3)
  DiscrTree for failure-path latency only. None block P2.
- 2026-07-30 — **P2 satellite 2A GREEN** (fca93bf, ScatterSynth) +
  three supervisor decisions under FLAG 2 discretion: (i)
  **FormulaTables/BotEval retained as-is** — no machine content,
  they are already the abstract layer; (ii) **the base case
  (baseCom = reprCom + botCom fold) retained old-style** — botCom
  recurses on formula syntax and generates cell names, outside
  fixed-program synthesis; re-deriving reprCom alone buys nothing
  while botCom stays; (iii) **the tower/hand boundary is pinned**:
  tower synthesizes leaf engines; the name-generating recursion
  (botCom, per-depth driver assembly) is retained capital. Scatter
  phase 2 (greedy scan) + Cover + order phase all queue behind
  **tool wave T1** (word-ram, single-owner, after ElimSynth lands):
  (a) `fri` bound-tuple split — the blocking gap; (b) BRefine junk
  rule; (c) `sepref_brefine_rules` DB + driver emission of
  perm/frame; (d) promote mopSucc/mopAddIn to a shared module;
  (e) frameMatch named-assertion diagnostic. Probe capital: a
  synthesized engine registers as a leaf `sepref_fr_rules` op and
  fires (engine-in-engine composition works; precondition must be
  spelled as conjuncts, R2A/D-f).
- 2026-07-30 (continued) — **P2 SYNTHESIS COMPLETE** in nine further
  waves + one tool wave: 2B′ (all Elim phases synthesized; mopPair
  skip-tax finding F-a), 2A′ (Scatter whole-engine, Progress into
  the abstract state), 2E (**the R=0 reduction**: augment fold is
  skip — RamAugment retained, no counting sorts; ordering phase
  fully derived + BRefine-covered), 2C′ (outPass complete, round
  cancelled per R=0 ruling), 2B″/2B‴ (Elim engine export
  elimEngine_le with the rank bound restored; 2B″'s cost prediction
  corrected by 2B‴ — dropped A₂·ls term; honest 296n+127ns+41),
  2D+2F (Cover turn loop + the cluster reduction map + all mask/
  load leaves; clusterLoad 16n²→12n+15m — first touched-only proof
  of the load half), 2G (expandCom — the LAST leaf; the n·ns
  product dies: 47n+30ns+4 vs (24ns+44)n+6). **T2 tool wave
  (Fable, db-branch merged)**: BRefine nested-while + junk rules +
  brefine driver (−52%/−77% measured), bpre→BRefine run adapter,
  bind_ref_tag normalization, Bounds.lean promotion zero-breakage.
  Endgame launched: F1 mop-up (five-phase Elim export + ReachedList,
  Opus) ∥ Integration-A (Σ-shape driver revision + swap design,
  Fable) → Integration-B waves → P4.
- 2026-07-30 — **P2 satellites 2B (afde8b3) + 2C (c0e08f5) GREEN**:
  ElimSynth (five-phase twin, 12 golden #guards first-build; degree
  pass 36n+23ns+4 vs old 48n+44ns+10; rezero/ElimMem debt dies by
  the layer argument) and AugmentSynth (5/10 passes; slotCnt_out_eq
  becomes cntPass_spec, a pass postcondition; K₁,₄ coupling bites
  the file's own program). Gap narrowing across satellites fed T1.
- 2026-07-30 — **T1 TOOL WAVE LANDED (db68602, Fable)**: the D-a
  stall was whole-vs-split tuple spelling in `mergeSolve` pairing
  (both prior hypotheses pass in isolation) — fixed via
  conjunctsSplit normalization (T1/D-a); bound-tuple split in three
  organs (fri simps T1/D-b, componentwise junkConjunct T1/D-d,
  lazy matchLoop splitting T1/D-f) + a live-caught junk/absAgree
  soundness guard (T1/D-e); shared mops (IrOpsExtra); wide-state
  packN dissolved by measurement (11-deep state ≈18 s — crawls,
  doesn't break). degPass: 3-min timeout → seconds; bfsThenSweep
  and cntThenPref both green kernel-three. BRefine tooling memo'd
  (junk rule, nested-while rule, brefine DB, Bounds.lean
  promotion) — bounded tax ~50 lines/loop until then. Loop states
  are resources: assemble with mopPair/pack, never literal tuples
  (P4/D-m linearity — put in every P2 brief).
- 2026-07-31 — **F-c PARTIAL — the symmetrization landed, the
  `orderCom` rewiring is NOT** (this session). Delivered green,
  zero consumer breakage: (i) **`RamDriver.symCom`** — the pass
  B5 approved, `RamAugment.outPass` + one `fillUpto` over the
  offsets (a vertex's degree in `D.toGraph` is its in-degree plus
  its out-degree, so the union's offsets are the *sums* of the two
  structures' offsets — no second counting sort) + `symRow`, two
  `blockScan`s per vertex; (ii) its walk **`symPass_run`**
  (`RamDriverAugment`, §Symmetrize, ~600 lines) leaving
  `RamElim.CsrSimple D.toGraph (m+m)` in `off`/`tgt`, with
  `symCopy_run` / `csrSimple_of_rowsDone` /
  `slotCnt_eq_card_outSet` / `card_symNbrs` / `two_mul_arcs_le` as
  reusable capital; (iii) the **§5.4 `P` slot** in
  `RamDriver.OrderImplements`, instantiated `fun _ _ => True` at
  every existing call site (`orderImplements₀`,
  `levelImplements`'s `horder`, `OrderBridge`'s three
  statements) — `driverRoot_decides_sentence` byte-identical;
  (iv) the **K₁,₄ symmetrization gate** in `TgtWidenProbe`:
  differential refutation of the old text (its final elimination
  reports the *star's* bound `kmax = 1`, the symmetrized run the
  *augmented* graph's `kmax = 4` — `(D₁).toGraph = K₅` seen cell
  by cell), plus `symCom` stuck at the level's 8 slots and
  completing at `R = 0`.
  **NOT landed, and what B7 inherits**: the `orderCom` text
  rewiring (`symCom` inserted after the fold, `restoreCsr` moved
  after the final elimination) with the `R = 0` re-discharge of
  `orderImplements₀` at the new text, and the `R*` fold. Both are
  unblocked, not merely unstarted — see the F-c report.
- 2026-07-31 — **F-c-3 PARTIAL — the widened cover chain landed, both
  bare slots addressed, the `LevelPre` flip BLOCKED ON DATA** (this
  session; full `lake build` + root `lax build --only proofs` green,
  kernel-three, no `sorry`, zero consumer breakage,
  `driverRoot_decides_sentence` byte-identical). Three items.

  **(A) Cover widening — steps 2–4 landed, step 5 blocked.** Additive
  and green: `Refine.BfsBridge.csr_of_csrGraphW` + `bfsQCom_specW`;
  `RamCover.CoverPreW`/`CoverStateW`/`ImplementsW`/`cover_specW`
  (accessors restated once on `CoverStateW`; every pinned form is the
  `nt = ns` instance on the nose, RamElim's precedent);
  `RamDriverOrder.centreStep_specW`/`coverTurnImplementsW`/
  `coverPass_specW`. Differential `#guard`s in `RamCover.Demo`: the
  padded run `demoRunPad` — two slots written past the structure's six
  — agrees with the exact run cell for cell at all four settings of the
  worked example, and the two clocks differ, so the check has teeth;
  plus a refutation that the padding hypothesis is not implied by
  `CsrGraph`.
  **L-8, the flip's blocker.** The widened relation needs `T j < n` at
  the *padding* slots — F-a's documented residual, since `BfsQ.Shape`
  keeps its range clause over the whole physical array (`Ir.StateBound`
  is state-global, and four ND-MC passes read the same clause at full
  width). That clause cannot be added to `LevelPre`: `n = 0` is
  reachable (`WordBound` permits it) and makes `∀ j < W, T j < n` false
  for every `W > 0`, so `LevelPre` would be unsatisfiable and
  `RamDriverIO.decodeImplements` could not establish it. The
  satisfiable form is a **zero-padded tail** — `∀ j, ns ≤ j → j < W →
  T j = 0`, which yields the clause wherever a centre turn runs, since
  a turn carries `c < n` — and its price is a reshape the F-c-2 map did
  not have: `DecodeMem` becomes `length = W` with the tail zeroed, and
  the decode's walk must show its `ns` stores leave the tail alone. The
  tail then survives a level, because `saveCsr`/`restoreCsr` copy all
  `W` slots. Full record at `RamDriver.LevelPre`'s docstring.

  **(B) `orderImplementsR` — the interface landed, the walk not.**
  `RamDriverCompose.OrderP` (the slot value: `∃ D d₀ k,
  CoverDegree.AugChainData (masked G M) D π R d₀ k`), `relinkCost`,
  `orderPhaseCostR n ns W R = orderPhaseCost n ns W + R · (augCost n W +
  relinkCost n W)` with its `R = 0` and monotonicity readings, and
  `OrderImplementsR` as a named `def`. The residual is itemized in that
  section: the fold's chain-carrying induction (the family `D` is built
  round by round out of `AugPost`'s existential, `isAugChain_succ` /
  `greedyFratRound_succ` growing the two clauses), one `W` for every
  round via `TgtCoupling.chainWidth_dominates`, the two `ElimPost`s
  that steps (3) and (10) of `orderImplements₀` already produce and
  discard, the syntax section at general `R`, and
  `AugmentedDepthOneDensity` as an inherited hypothesis.
  **L-9, and its repair.** The `P` slot F-c anchored was *dropped*:
  `RamDriverCluster.levelImplements` destructured the phase's witness
  away one line after it arrived, and its `hmass` slot had no place for
  it — which left the root's `hdeg` asking for the cover degree at
  **every** permutation, a hypothesis nothing can discharge, since
  `CoverDegree.exists_cover_degree` is about the ordering of a chain's
  last elimination. Repaired: `hmass` takes `P π ord` beside
  `RamCover.OrdersBy`, `levelAt` supplies it with `_` at `R = 0` (no
  statement above this moved), and `RamDriverRoot.wreachDeg_of_orderP`
  / `exists_wreachDeg_of_orderP` are the proved step from the slot to
  the coefficient.

  **(C) `hbinj` closed.** `Refine.MassMath.blockInj_of_coverOut` is
  `RamCover.CoverOut.block_inj`: B3's clause and B6's `BlockInj` came
  out identical clause for clause, so the projection B6 designed is one
  field access. `RamDriverRoot.blockInj_slot` states it at the slot's
  own type and `driverRoot_decides_sentence_binj` is the plug check
  (B8's discipline at a slot with no arithmetic in it). B6's stale
  header and falsification prose corrected; the hypothesis is *kept* on
  the mass lemmas — they are about block data, not about a pass — and
  the `badXoff` control still shows it is load-bearing.

  **B7's hypothesis table.** Of the 29 slots, 27 are input-word data,
  parameter equations or cost side conditions and always had honest
  producers; `hbinj` (#24) now has one; `hdeg` (#25) has a *named*
  producer waiting on `OrderImplementsR` and nothing else. Probe family
  (`TgtWidenProbe`, K₁,₄ / `sym5*`) re-run green.

- 2026-07-31 — **rebase F-c-4: the `tgt` flip landed; `relinkCost`
  walked and found wrong.** Worktree `ndmc-rebase-p0`, on `c41f3f7`.
  Full `lake build` green (3523 jobs), `lax build --only proofs
  nowhere-dense-model-checking` OK, no `sorry`, kernel-three.

  **(A) The flip.** `RamDriver.LevelPre`'s `tgt` clause is now `arrOf W
  T` — the allocation width, not the block structure's `ns` — with two
  conjuncts appended: the **zero-padded tail** `∀ z, ns ≤ z → z < W → T
  z = 0` and the word clause `∀ z < W, T z < B`. Appending rather than
  inserting is what kept the ~20 destructuring walks to two extra
  binders apiece. `OrderMem`'s `("gtg", ns)` became `("gtg", W)`;
  `RamDriver.saveCsr`/`restoreCsr` took a `W` parameter and copy `.lit
  W` (program text), with `RamDriverOrder.csrCopy_spec`/`saveCsr_spec`/
  `restoreCsr_spec` and `RamDriverCompose.warrs_saveCsr`/
  `warrs_restoreCsr`/`alvName_notMem_saveCsr` following.

  **Why zero and not "a vertex".** L-8's blocker was real and the
  refutation is now in `TgtWidenProbe`'s flip gate: the range form `∀
  j, ns ≤ j → j < W → T j < n` is unsatisfiable at `n = 0`, which
  `WordBound` permits and the empty input word reaches, so `LevelPre`
  carrying it could never be established. Zero padding is satisfiable
  at every `n` and *yields* the range form wherever a turn runs
  (`RamDriver.pad_lt_of_zero`, from `c < n`). Consequence for the
  landed F-c-3 chain: `RamCover.ImplementsW`/`cover_specW` and
  `RamDriverOrder.centreStep_specW`/`coverPass_specW` now take `hpad`
  **guarded by `0 < n`**. That is the one reshape inside F-c-3's
  widened chain; it is consumed at exactly one place (the search inside
  the turn), where `σ.vars "c" < n` is in scope.

  **The decode.** `RamDriver.DecodeMem` gained `W`: `tgt` is `W` cells
  with the tail above `ns` zeroed. `RamDriverIO.readLoop_specW` is the
  new widened read loop — the invariant carries `Fill.Below` at the
  *physical* width plus `i ≤ k` and the tail clause, and the body shows
  the store index stays below `k`; `readLoop_spec` is now its `W = k`
  instance and is not re-walked. `decodeImplements` threads it and
  gains `hpad0` as a hypothesis, `T` being the caller's function.
  `TgtWidenProbe.decodeTail` is the differential: the decode run on the
  demo `K₁,₄` tape into a `20`-cell `tgt` with a sentinel tail leaves
  all twelve padding slots holding `7`.

  **Reach.** F-c-3's map said "the widened chain is fully landed"; that
  was true of `RamElim`/`RamAugment`/`RamCover`/`RamScatter`/
  `BfsBridge`/`RamBfsPaths`, and *not* of `RamDriverDescend`'s own
  passes, which were all pinned at `ns` through the reasoning kit's
  `Csr`. Those are now stated at a width parameter over
  `CsrWide.CsrW`/`CsrWide.loadRow_spec` — `RamDriverCluster.ExpandInv`/
  `ScanHit`, `expandStep_spec`, `expandCom_spec`, `chainCom_spec`,
  `chainCom_stages`, `ColPre`, `pdBody`/`pdCom`/`puBody`/`puCom`/
  `colourCom_spec`, `ballCom_spec`, `ancestorStep_spec`, `BatchEnv`,
  `batchFold_spec`, `batchCom_spec`, and the parent search through
  `RamBfsPaths.bfsPar_specW`. Fifteen surfaces, no new mathematics.
  Likewise `RamDriverIO`'s `RootPre` is read at `Ws` and the root
  scatter enters through `RamScatter.scatter_specW`, and
  `RamDriverFrames`'s cluster scatter through the same, with
  `ScatPre.nsW` the new accessor.

  **Cost.** `orderPhaseCost`'s `W` coefficient rose `20 → 60`: the two
  block-structure copies are charged at `W` now, not at `ns`
  (`28·W` of it). `Refine.OrderBridge`'s `#guard` moved `22350 →
  22750`; `OrderSynth`'s comparison prose was stale from F-c-2 and is
  corrected to the current def.

  **Hypothesis reshapes (ledgered).** `driverRoot_decides_sentence` and
  `driverRoot_decides_sentence_binj`: precondition `DecodeMem n ns σ →
  DecodeMem n ns W σ`, one new hypothesis `hpad0` (#7 of now **30**
  slots — F-c-3's count of 29 plus this one; `hbinj` is #25 and `hdeg`
  #26). `driver_correct` gained `hWB : W < B` and `hpad0`.
  `DecodeImplements` gained `W < B`, `ns ≤ W` and `hpad0`.
  **The conclusions are byte-identical**: the program `driverRoot q_top
  cap mb 0 ℓ W φ`, the postcondition `σ'.out = [if Sat G Fin.elim0 φ
  then 1 else 0]` and the cost `Kdec + (Kl 0 n + Ksent)` are unmoved,
  and `RamDriverCluster.levelImplements` is untouched. Plug discipline
  re-run: `levelAt_of_sigma` and `driverRoot_decides_sentence_binj`
  both still type-check.

  **(B) `OrderImplementsR` — not landed; one item of it is.**
  `relinkCost` was F-c-3's "generous, not yet walked" constant and the
  walk **refutes it**: the nine passes of `augRelinkCom W` come to
  `97·n + 12·W + 115` (`RamDriverCompose.relinkCostSum`,
  `relinkCostSum_eq`), and `100·n + 20·W + 100` is below that on every
  carrier under five vertices — `relinkCost_old_refuted` at `n = W = 0`
  (`115 > 100`), with `#guard`s at `n = 4` (fails) and `n = 5` (holds).
  The constant is repaired to `120`, so `orderPhaseCostR` is now a
  budget the fold can actually be proved at. The `n` and `W`
  coefficients were indeed generous; the constant was not.

  The fold walk itself is **open**, and the flip removed work from it
  rather than adding any: every surface the fold has to thread is now
  stated at `W`, so items 1–3 and 5 of the `Rstar` residual stand as
  written, item 4 (the syntax section at general `R`) is unchanged, and
  item 6 (the cost) is closed. Probe family re-run green:
  `TgtWidenProbe` (K₁,₄ / `sym5*` / the new flip gate), `RamCover.Demo`,
  `RamAugment.Demo`, the padded-run differentials.

- 2026-07-31 — **rebase F-c-5: `orderImplementsR` LANDED — the last
  obligation before the headline theorem; the fold body was refuted and
  repaired on the way.** Worktree `ndmc-rebase-p0`, on `03df23e`. Full
  `lake build` green, `lax build --only proofs
  nowhere-dense-model-checking` OK, no `sorry`, kernel-three, zero
  consumer breakage (`driverRoot_decides_sentence`,
  `driverRoot_decides_sentence_binj`, `levelAt_of_sigma`,
  `orderImplements₀` and everything above byte-identical in statement).

  **(A) The defect, compiled before any proof (refute-before-prove).**
  The R = 1 probe the brief mandated — `orderCom 1 64 0` run end to end
  on a `K₁,₄` level state — found the landed fold body **stuck**:
  `RamAugment.AugPre` asks for `off`, `elm` and `bh` zeroed at every
  round's entry, the phase's *first* elimination leaves `elm` all-ones
  and `bh` dirty, `off` holds the level's structure until the first
  relink, and `augRelinkCom` re-zeroes `off` but never `elm`/`bh` (the
  round's inner elimination re-dirties them). Wave D4's defect A one
  pass earlier: at `R ≥ 1`, `n ≥ 1` the obligation was refuted, not
  unproved. `TgtWidenProbe`'s new R = 1 gate is the record: the old text
  (written out as `orderComOld1`) sticks, the fold-entry state shows
  `elm = [1,1,1,1,1]`, and the repaired text completes.
  **The repair** (session repair, D4's precedent): `RamDriver.augPrepCom`
  — `fillUpto "off"` + `elimRezeroCom`, the minimal three fills — inside
  the new fold body `RamDriver.augRoundCom W`, so `foldRange _ 0 = skip`
  keeps the `R = 0` text **byte-identical** and `orderImplements₀`
  re-checks untouched. Two cost constants fell with it. `relinkCost`
  repaired a second time, `100n+20W+120 → 140n+20W+170`, now the budget
  for twelve passes (`prepCostSum + relinkCostSum = 134n+12W+163`;
  `prep_relink_le`, with `#guard`s recording that F-c-4's constant
  cannot pay for the prep). And **`orderPhaseCostR`'s round coefficient
  was refuted as landed**: at `R ≥ 1` the symmetrization and the final
  elimination charge at up to `W` slots (`2m ≤ ns` is an `R = 0` fact),
  up to `650·W` beyond the fixed part's `60·W`, while the fold's own
  component budgets consume the whole round term. Repaired with a
  `650·W` surcharge on the coefficient (`… + R·(augCost + relinkCost +
  650·W)`; same `R`-linear shape P3 consumes, `R = 0` reading
  unchanged); the accounting `#guard` at the smallest widened shape
  (`n=0, W=2, 2m=W, R=1`: components `26194` vs old budget `24980`) is
  the record.

  **(B) The theorem.** `RamDriverCompose.orderImplementsR {…} (hd :
  LowDegreeVertices (masked G M) d) (hdens : ∀ D i, i ≤ R → IsAugChain →
  Greedy → AugmentedDepthOneDensity D i D₁) (hWc : chainWidth n d D₁ R ≤
  W) : OrderImplementsR B n R W cap mb ns j G O T M Gm C` — the
  thirteen-step walk at general `R`. The fold is `fold_run_aux` over
  `fold_step` with invariant `FoldInv`: machine side (Sized scratch,
  re-zeroed accumulators/stamps, `ntg` word clause, `doff`/`dtg` =
  the chain's last orientation) ∧ chain side (`IsAugChain` + greedy
  clauses to `i`, `(D 0).InDegLE d₀`, `InCsr (D i) m' DO DT`, `m' ≤ W`,
  and `i = 0 → m'+m' ≤ ns` — the clause that keeps the R = 0 cost at
  `ns`). Per round: `augPrep_spec` (new), `RamAugment.augment_specW` off
  `RamDriverAugment.implementsW`, `augRelink_spec` (new — the nine
  passes walked as a Spec, F-c-4 only summed their costs); the chain
  grows by the `if l = i+1` update, `AugPost`'s `AugStep` +
  `GreedyFratRound`. Width thread: `greedy_chain_inDegLE` +
  `budget_mono` + `augWidth_mono` + `chainWidth_eq_augWidth` (rfl); the
  symmetrization fits by `arcs_le` + `2b ≤ (b+1)²`. Both `ElimPost`s are
  now *kept*: the first is the chain's foot (`d₀ = ka`, minimality
  against the arena, `ka ≤ d` via `hd`), the second — on the
  symmetrized `(D R).toGraph` — its head (`k`, minimality), with
  `masked_of_all_alive` collapsing the all-ones mask.
  **L-10, and its repair.** `ordCom_spec`'s postcondition quantifies the
  permutation away, and nothing ties the exported `π` to the final
  elimination's rank — information-theoretically unrecoverable from its
  statement (the ∃ hides the inversion). `ordCom_specData` is the landed
  proof with the final weakening removed (the loop invariant already
  carries `g (R v) = v`); `π := RamCover.rankPerm` at the kept data, so
  `(π v : ℕ) = R₂ v` definitionally and the exported `OrderP` bundle's
  `BackDegLE` is the final elimination's, transported across the two
  rank reads by `arrOf` agreement.
  Syntax at general `R`: `mem_wvars/warrs_orderCom` decompose into the
  landed R = 0 sets ∨ the round's (`mem_*_foldRange_const`, write sets
  W-independent by `rfl`), `noWrite_orderCom` by per-component `decide`.

  **(C) The probes.** `TgtWidenProbe` R = 1 gate: old text stuck; new
  text ok at R = 0/1/2 with the differential `kmax = 1 / 2 / 2` — the
  machine's own chain augments `K₁,₄` to the double star (one leaf into
  the centre, centre into three ⇒ three transitive links, no fraternal
  edge; smaller than the hand-fed `sym5Final` K₅ and the honest
  instance, being the phase's own run); order arrays `[1,0,2,3,4]` /
  `[0,2,1,3,4]`; exit state = entry state (structure + zero tail
  restored, `elm`/`bh` re-zeroed). All landed guards re-run green.

  **B7's `hdeg` discharge, end to end.** `horder :=
  orderImplementsR hd hdens hWc` replaces `orderImplements₀` at
  `P := OrderP R G M`, cost `orderPhaseCostR n ns W R`; then with
  `⟨c, hc⟩ := RamDriverRoot.exists_wreachDeg_of_orderP C hC cap R t ht
  hrt δ hδ` and `Kmass := ⌈c·n^δ⌉₊`, the slot value discharges `hdeg`
  via `RamDriverRoot.wreachDeg_of_orderP` — the conditional (per-`π`)
  form `levelImplements`'s repaired `hmass` consumes. Slot #26 now has
  a landed producer; all 30 slots do.

- 2026-07-31 — **B7 STOPPED AT THE GATE: C0 is not dischargeable from
  the landed capital — two compiled findings, no forced assembly**
  (this session; worktree `ndmc-rebase-p0` on `f70d993`). New file
  `Lax3Proofs/C0Probe.lean` + root import; full `lake build` green
  (3524 jobs), `lax build --only proofs` OK, all three headline
  theorems kernel-three; nothing frozen touched, zero consumer
  breakage; no C0.lean.

  **(G1, the brief's designated suspect, confirmed) `EncodesGraph` ⇏
  `CsrSimple` — slot #6 is underivable at the C0 boundary.**
  `Lax11.GraphEncoding.EncodesGraph` deliberately permits a row to
  name a neighbour twice (its own notes; `adj_iff` is an existential),
  and `driverRoot_decides_sentence`'s `hcsr` forbids it. Compiled:
  `C0Probe.dupWord = [2,2,0,2,4,1,1,0,0]` is a genuine `EncodesGraph`
  word for `K₂` whose row 0 is `[1,1]`; `encodesGraph_not_csrSimple`
  exhibits it at the root theorem's own instantiation (`offset x` /
  `target x` / `2·edgeCount x`). D4's "root input DATA" ruling is
  thereby wrong at the C0 boundary, where the input predicate is
  `EncodesGraph` alone. Repair: a dedup guard between decode and the
  first level — `driverRoot = decodeCom ; driverAt 0 ; sentenceCom`
  and `driver_correct`'s decode slot is already a hypothesis, so the
  splice is a new root text + a composed `DecodeImplements` (mark/
  collect/unmark per row, trail-pattern cost `O(n + ns)`, the P0.4
  acceptance covers the shape) + a `CsrSimple`-of-dedup lemma; one
  satellite wave.

  **(G2, found on the way, outranks G1) the landed cost interface has
  a compiled `Ω(n·W)` floor, and the C0 path pins `W ≥ n² + 1`.**
  `C0Probe.level_interface_floor`: from `driverRoot_decides_sentence`'s
  `hKs` (#20), `hKo` (#22), `hKl` (#27) **verbatim**, every admissible
  `Kl` at `ℓ ≥ 2` pays `n·(60·W + 1600·n) ≤ Kl 0 n` — `hKo` charges
  `orderPhaseCost n ns W` at every arena including the empty one (the
  R1.6 touched-only debt, named open in `levelCost_of_sigma`'s own
  docstring), `turnCost` carries `Kin` additively, and `hKl` runs up
  to `n` turns. So even at `W = ns` the floor is `1600·n²` — already
  over C0's budget for every `ε < 1` on sparse members. And the C0
  path cannot run at `W = ns`: the mass bound needs `R = R* > 0`
  (integration-design §2.3, compiled), `orderImplementsR`'s `hWc` pins
  `chainWidth n d D₁ R ≤ W`, and `chainWidth` carries an `n·n` term
  for the level's own graph ⇒ `60·n³ ≤ Kl 0 n`
  (`level_interface_floor_cubic`). Teeth: two `#guard`s beat the
  `ε = 1` and `ε = 1/2` budgets at generous constants on sparse
  instances; the quantifier order (c before n) finishes. The floor is
  also a *program* floor (paper half, F1's precedent): `orderCom R W j`
  opens with `saveCsr` copying `.lit W` cells at every level entry,
  up to `n` entries per depth. §2.4's "yes" verdict assumed R1.6's
  block-driven nested phases, which never landed in the cost surface.
  Repairs (owner decisions, in order of the money): (i) R1.6/R1.8
  honestly — nested order/cover/base phases charged at the arena
  (tower re-derivations + interface re-thread of `hKo`/`hKc`/`hKd`/
  `hKbase` to size-read forms); (ii) live-width save/restore + a
  degree-aware `chainWidth` (drop the `n·n` term against the chain's
  budget; the symmetrized round is degree-bounded by `arcs_le`) so `W`
  enters at `O(n·budget²)` and is copied only at its live prefix;
  (iii) fallback checkpoint per the plan's hard clause — noting the
  frozen old-style wave inherits the same floors.

  **Not done, deliberately**: `levelAtR`/`driverRoot_decides_sentenceR`
  (the general-`R` restatement) and the `Solves`/`computesInTime_of_solves`
  bridge scaffolding — both reshape under (i)/(ii), so landing them now
  is certain rework; the F-c-5 `hdeg` composition note stands unchanged
  for whoever re-runs B7 after the repair waves. C0's concept axiom
  stays an axiom; P5 is blocked behind the two repairs + a re-run B7.

## Seam probe findings (2026-08-02) — `Refine/BridgeSeamProbe.lean`

The `Spec → ComputesInTime` bridge was the last never-probed seam, and both
B7 gate findings had been boundary facts of exactly that kind. It was probed
before resuming the residue chain, under the standing rule that the accounting
must be **compiled**. It was worth it: two of the four questions are blocked,
and one of the blocks is unconditional.

**Finding 3 — the layout does not fit in the words C0 hands it.
`no_word_size_for_sparse`. Unconditional; no cost repair reaches it.**

The driver addresses an `n × n` cluster arena (`xmem`, `xmmName j` in
`LevelMem`/`DepthMem`), so the root theorem's own `hB : WordBound B n ns cap
mb` pins `n*n + ns + 2*cap + 2 < B`. `computesInTime_of_spec` adds
`L.FitsWords (B x) w`, whose `bound` field gives `B ≤ 2 ^ w`. But C0's domain
is `{x | EncodesGraph x n G ∧ ∀ v ∈ x, c*(|x|+v+1) ≤ 2^w}` and the statement
quantifies over **all** `w` — so the smallest admissible word length is in
scope, where `2^w` is linear in `|x|`. Compiled: for every `c` and every `n`
past the crossover `4c(n+2) ≤ n²`, at the edgeless graph there is a `w` where
the word is in C0's domain and `FitsWords ∧ WordBound` are jointly
unsatisfiable. `#guard`ed at `c = 10⁹`, `n = 10¹²`, with two negative controls
(below the crossover the hypothesis fails; the two conditions are satisfiable
on their own at a free word length).

This is a **space** fact: no cost interface occurs in it, no width path, no
`chainWidth`, `R = 0` throughout. Corollary `width_lt_two_pow` re-reads B7
finding 2 from this side — `n + W + 1 < B ≤ 2^w` makes the `chainWidth ≤ W`
pin *unaddressable* rather than merely cubic.

**Finding 4 — the landed precondition is not `initEnv`-reachable.
`rootPre_initEnv_iff_ns_zero`. Local, and the repair is cheap.**

`solves_of_spec` demands the precondition be exactly `σ = initEnv ext x`, and
`initEnv` zeroes every scalar. Seven of the eight conjuncts are
lengths/zero/word clauses and transfer for free — the array half of the
prologue costs nothing, since `ext` supplies it per input. The eighth is
`OrderMem`'s `ns ≤ σ.vars "lw"`, which at `initEnv` reads `ns ≤ 0`: the landed
`Spec` feeds `solves_of_spec` on edge-free words and nothing else.

A prologue cannot repair it *in place*: the same precondition demands
`σ.inp = x`, and `read_breaks_inp` shows one cell read already breaks that
conjunct. But the value is `2·edgeCount x`, and G1's `dedupCom` already opens
by computing the same number off the decode's own `m`. Repair: set `"lw"`
beside `"dq"` and let the composed decode phase take `OrderMem B n 0 W` in and
deliver `OrderMem B n ns W`. Cost `4` (`lwCom_spec`), not a floor. Lands with
the `driverRootD` restatement in the B7 re-run.

**Questions 2 and 4 close.** The prologue's *cost* is a non-issue —
`Harness.lean`'s marshalling is bypassed entirely because the driver decodes
the tape itself. The output side closes with a witness (`out_shape`): the root
postcondition is already C0's `f x`, there is no epilogue to pay for, and
`σ.out = []` comes from `initEnv` free.

**Method note.** `PrologueBlind` (the array-length bisimulation) is stated as
a named `Prop` and left unproved, never a `sorry`, with the reason recorded:
nothing rests on it, because finding 3 is unconditional and finding 4's
placement conclusion already follows from `read_breaks_inp`.

## Arena width (2026-08-02) — `Refine/ArenaWidth.lean`, and a supervisor correction

**The correction first.** After the seam probe, the supervisor retargeted
E-mem at "retire the `n × n` block-membership arena so the `n*n` term leaves
`WordBound`". That premise was wrong, and the wave rejected it with the
landed source in hand.

`LevelMem`/`DepthMem` **do not feed `WordBound`, and array lengths never
reach the bridge at all.** `Compile.Layout.span = temps + scalars.length +
arrays.length * B` — the word length sees the layout's array *count* and the
value bound `B`, never the length of an IMP+ list. `Transfer.Solves.run`'s own
docstring says it: "the declared array lengths are chosen per input … and the
compiled program does not represent them at all". The supervisor had read and
quoted `Layout.span` earlier the same day and still wrote the brief on the
opposite premise.

The single route from the arena to the word length is the **literal `n * n`
inside `RamDriver.WordBound`**, and it is there because the passes form the
arena *pointer as a value*, with `RamCover.CoverInv.ptr_le : xp ≤ c * n` as
the only ceiling the pass carries. So this is a **value-bound repair and the
`n × n` allocation stays exactly where it is** — far cheaper than changing the
representation.

**New slot shape.**

```lean
def WordBoundK (B n K ns cap mb : ℕ) : Prop :=
  n * K + n + ns + 2 * cap + 2 < B  ∧  mb < B
```

`K` is the root theorem's *existing* `hdeg` parameter `Kmass`; `+ n` covers the
block scan's `xp + n`. An exact generalization, not a weakening:
`wordBoundK_pred_iff : WordBoundK B n (n-1) ns cap mb ↔ WordBound B n ns cap
mb`, with all five projections the driver takes re-derived.

**Finding 3 flipped, compiled at C0's own quantifier order** (`c` fixed before
`n`, `w`, `x`): `word_size_for_encoded` / `exists_wordConst` give, for every
layout with an array and every constant profile `(K, cap, mb)`, a `B` with
`FitsWords B w ∧ WordBoundK …` at every word of C0's domain and every
admissible `w`. Sharpest form — `flip_at_the_refuting_instance`: at the *same*
`n`, word and `w` where `no_word_size_for_sparse` refutes `WordBound` for
every `B`, a `B` exists for `WordBoundK`.

**Three controls, all proved refutations rather than assertions.**
`no_wordConst_at_square` (the identical statement is false for `WordBound`, so
the width is what does the work); `no_wordConst_at_linear_degree` (false when
the degree parameter grows with the instance); `no_wordConst_growing_layout`
(false when the layout's array count grows with `n` — so the `span` conjunct
is load-bearing and the flip rests on the driver's array count being constant
in `n`).

**The new mathematics.** `CoverInv.ptr_le_mass`: against the landed
invariant's own clauses, with weak-`2r`-reachability degree bounded by `d`
(the root's `hdeg` slot verbatim), the cover pass's write pointer is `≤ n * d`
at every centre boundary — `MassMath`'s double count read over the *prefix* of
blocks already built, so it is available *during* the pass, which
`MassMath.mass_le` (exit-only) is not. `block_scan_lt` closes it to the slot.
This replaces the trivial `xp ≤ c * n` that `n * n` was paying for.

**Threading — ALL THREE WAVES LANDED 2026-08-02. Finding 3 is CLOSED.**

1. **W1 (hard, single owner)** — re-walk `RamCover.centreStep`/`coverCom` at
   `CoverImplementsK`, and `RamDriverOrder`'s emission scan `hnnB : n*n < B`.
   The `hxp₀ : xp₀ + n ≤ n*n` *allocation* clause is untouched.
   `ptr_le_mass` is the replacement reading.
2. **W2 (mechanical, wide)** — `WordBound` → `WordBoundK` through
   `RamDriver` (20 sites), `RamDriverDescend` (18), `RamDriverCluster` (4),
   `RamDriverFrames`, `RamDriverIO`, `RamDriverCompose`,
   `Refine/{DeadSweep,OrderBridge,G2CostProbe}`. `LevelMem`/`DepthMem`/
   `RamDriverBase` do **not** move.
3. **W3** — root restatement `hB : WordBoundK B n Kmass ns cap mb`, carried
   into the B7 re-run.

One named `Prop`, no `sorry`: `CoverImplementsK`, with
`coverImplementsK_of_implements` compiling that it is a generalization (the
landed obligation gives it at `d = n`), so the slot change costs no landed
capital.

## Finding 3 — repaired at the slot, NOT yet at the root (2026-08-02)

**Heading corrected the same day by the S1 slot sweep.** What follows is
sound and unchanged: the word-bound repair works *at the slot*. What it does
not yet do is work *at the root*, because the root's `hdeg` slot forces
`Kmass ≥ n`, and at `Kmass ≥ n` the new bound **is** the retired carrier bound
(`SlotSweep.wordBound_of_deg_slot`, `no_word_size_through_deg_slot`). See
"Slot sweep" below. Threading the right producer is S3.

W1 (`99bc9f4`), W2 (`ff0670a`) and W3 landed the word-bound repair end to end.
The root's hypothesis is now

```lean
(hB : WordBoundK B n Kmass ns cap mb)
```

`Kmass` being the root's *existing* `hdeg` degree parameter — no new binder.
`driverRoot_decides_sentence` differs from its landed form in **exactly that
one line**: precondition, program, postcondition, cost and every other
hypothesis are byte-identical (verified by diff, not by report).

**The crossing is compiled, and the control is what makes it honest.**

- `no_word_size_at_root` — `BridgeSeamProbe.no_word_size_for_sparse` restated
  at the root's slot is **false**.
- `word_size_at_carrier` — the **identical statement shape** at the retired
  `WordBound` is **true**. So the difference is the slot and nothing else:
  not the quantifier order, not the witness family.
- `root_flip_at_the_refuting_instance` — at the very `w` where the old bound
  is refuted for every `B`, the restated root's slot has one.
- `driverRoot_decides_sentence_bound` — the plug check: the root restated with
  `RootBound` in that position, proved by the root itself. Break tests
  (run and reverted): degree bumped to `Kmass + 1` → 1 error; `RootBound`
  redefined as the carrier bound → 9 errors. Load-bearing on both the slot and
  the identification of the degree with `hdeg`'s.

**Two structural things the waves had to solve.** `WordBoundK` and then the
arena-pointer mathematics both sat *above* the driver in the import DAG
(`CoverWidth → ArenaWidth → BridgeSeamProbe → RamDriverRoot`), so no phase
obligation and then no root theorem could name what it needed. The definitions
moved down beside `WordBound` in `RamDriver.lean`, and §5/§1 of the two probe
files moved into a new low `Refine/ArenaPointer.lean`, with the old sites
`export`ing them so every landed name and `#print axioms` still resolves.
Second, the carrier ceiling had **two** consumers — the emission scan's
running pointer (`PtrWords`) and the pass's exit pointer `m` (`MassWords`) —
and `exitWords_not_free` proves the second is not derivable from the first
plus the allocation clause.

**What remains before C0.**

1. **Finding 4** (`rootPre_initEnv_iff_ns_zero`): the `OrderMem` clause
   `ns ≤ σ.vars "lw"` reads `ns ≤ 0` at `initEnv`, so the landed `Spec` feeds
   `solves_of_spec` on edge-free words only. Repair is cost 4 — set `"lw"`
   beside `dedupCom`'s `"dq"`, off the decode's own `m` — landing with the
   `driverRootD` restatement in the B7 re-run.

2. **B7 finding 2 — the interface cost floor — is NOT closed.** Correcting a
   supervisor error of 2026-08-02, propagated into the commit message of
   `aa2a702` and into the B7 brief: the `ArenaWidth` note said
   `width_lt_two_pow` "re-reads finding 2 from this side", which is true —
   it makes the `chainWidth ≤ W` pin unaddressable as a **word-length**
   matter. That was then restated as finding 2 being *closed by* finding 3.
   It is not. `width_lt_two_pow` and the whole `WordBoundK` repair are about
   the word length; neither touches a cost.

   `C0Probe.level_interface_floor` (`:161`) takes `hKs`, `hKo`, `hKl` in
   exactly the shapes the root still carries (`RamDriverRoot.lean:731`,
   `:734`, `:741`). `hKo : ∀ j m, orderPhaseCost n ns W ≤ Ko j m` is
   size-blind — it charges the ordering phase at carrier width at **every**
   arena, including the empty one — so even at `W = ns` the root's own cost is
   `≥ 1600·n²`, and on the C0 path `chainWidth`'s `n·n` term makes it `60·n³`
   (`level_interface_floor_cubic`). **C0 is unreachable through the root as it
   stands, and the repair is the cost residue, not B7.**

3. **The order-phase synthesis probe runs first, tower-side, in two
   halves (tower ledger E42).** The retry is the tower campaign's phase
   **P4.6**, immediately after its P4.5 (tower ledger E30); an earlier note
   scheduling it "at Gate G4, after C0" was self-contradictory (G4 requires
   C0, C0 requires the residue) and is superseded. This campaign's own
   no-escape theorem (`OrderBlockProbe` §1/§2) proves the **landed** order
   text cannot synthesize to a carrier-blind cost — the member-list
   interior is the only route — so the probe's halves carry different
   questions: **S** (whole-phase synthesis of the landed `orderPhase0`
   from an `hfref` signature) answers tractability and yields the phase as
   one `Com` plus the P7 profile; **M** (a standalone member-driven
   `orderPhaseM` with an explicit member-list argument, the E-mem shape
   without `LevelPre` threading) carries the landing criterion:
   **carrier-blind, compiled** — empty-arena charge O(1), clock invariant
   in `n` at fixed members. On M landing, E-mem threads member lists into
   `LevelPre` and the order/cover phases are re-derived from M-shaped
   signatures rather than repaired; most of the residue chain above stops
   existing. On an M miss, the no-escape verdict generalizes and the
   residue proceeds by hand after item 4, with the provisional-P5 draft
   recommendation going to Jan.

4. **`g2_exists` re-validation before any residue wave.** The residue's
   arithmetic — `g2_exists` and the E-mem budget chain — was compiled
   against the pre-P4.5 tower cost model. P4.5 changed the substrate (O(1)
   allocation, LIFO free, availability resources; tower ledger E25–E29),
   so if the probe misses and the residue proceeds, one short compiled wave
   first re-runs the existence probe against the post-P4.5 forms. The
   tower's E29 space budget also binds every residue and P9 design choice:
   on the C0 domain, live + LIFO-unreclaimable allocation must stay
   `O(|x|)`, so member lists and per-arena scratch stay caller-owned or
   LIFO-reused — per-turn fresh zeroed allocation is budget-fatal, and
   trail/touched-only reset remains the loop-interior discipline.

## Slot sweep (2026-08-02) — `Refine/SlotSweep.lean`, and finding 2 is not closed

The B7 re-run's opening leaf (rev 3 delta 3). All thirty slots of
`driverRoot_decides_sentence` compiled against what a C0 discharge actually
holds: `EncodesGraph x n G`, the domain word clause, `C n G` with `C` nowhere
dense, and free parameter choices — all of the latter made **before** `n`, `G`,
`w` and `x`, because C0 fixes the program and `c` first. The full table is in
the file header. Twenty-four slots are free or producered. **Six block, in
three independent groups.**

**Group 1 — #6 `hcsr`.** B7 finding 1. G1 repaired it in
`RamDriverDedup.DecodeImplementsD`, at `dedupNs/dedupOffset/dedupTarget`; the
root still reads `CsrSimple` at `2·edgeCount x / offset x / target x`. So the
slot has no producer *today* and one the moment the root moves to the composed
decode. `slot06_hcsr_blocked` / `slot06_hcsr_dedup`. Dies at `driverRootD`.

**Group 2 — #26 `hdeg`, and #12 `hB` with it. NEW, and it un-closes finding 3
at the root.** The slot is quantified over **every** permutation:

```lean
hdeg : ∀ M (π : Equiv.Perm (Fin n)) v, (wreach (masked G M) π (2*cap) v).ncard ≤ Kmass
```

Weak reachability is a property of the *ordering*. At `starLast n` — the star
with its centre ordered last — the centre weakly reaches the whole vertex set
at radius 1, so the slot forces `n ≤ Kmass` (`deg_slot_at_starLast`), and no
`Kmass` chosen before `n` satisfies it (`slot26_hdeg_blocked`). Negative
control: at the edgeless graph the same slot holds at `Kmass = 1`
(`deg_slot_at_bot`), so it is the graph and not the shape of `wreach`.

The consequence is exactly `ArenaWidth`'s own control 2. `WordBoundK B n Kmass
ns cap mb` with `Kmass ≥ n` **is** the retired carrier bound
(`wordBound_of_deg_slot`), and `no_wordConst_at_linear_degree` refutes the flip
there; `no_word_size_through_deg_slot` closes it back to `n*n < 2^w`. So the
E-mem/W1–W3 repair is sound at the slot and **not yet usable at the root**: the
root's `hdeg` is the wrong shape to supply the constant the flip needs. The
producer with the right shape exists —
`RamDriverRoot.exists_wreachDeg_of_orderP`, at orderings carrying
`RamDriverCompose.OrderP R` — and threading it *is* the `levelAtR` /
general-`R` restatement. Finding 3's closure now depends on B7's own S3.

**Group 3 — #20/#22/#23/#27, the cost group. Finding 2 is ALIVE and sharper.**

`level_cost_floor_cubic`: from `hKs` (#20) and `hKl` (#27) **alone**, at
`ℓ ≥ 1`, `16·n³ ≤ Kl 0 n`. `W` occurs in neither hypothesis, nor the
conclusion, nor the proof; no `chainWidth`, no `hWc`, no `R`. The mechanism is
`RamDriverDescend.descendCost`'s `16*(n*n)` inside `RamDriverRoot.turnCost`,
paid by every turn including one processing an empty block
(`turnCostSize_size_blind`), multiplied by `hKl`'s `n` turns at the root.
`level_cost_floor_sharp` adds `hKo` (#22) and `hKc` (#23) and reaches
`128·n³`. Plug check: `driverRoot_decides_sentence_floored` takes the root's
hypothesis list verbatim (plus `2 ≤ ℓ`) and returns the root's own unweakened
`Spec` **and** `128·n³ ≤ Kdec + (Kl 0 (n+ns) + Ksent)`; `hKmono` is what carries
the floor across E6's weight re-read. Over C0's budget at every `ε < 2`
(`#guard` at `ε = 1/2`, with an `ε = 3` control).

Responsible hypothesis shapes, i.e. the residue's work-list:

| slot | shape | repair |
|------|-------|--------|
| #20 `hKs` | turn charges `16·n²` for the level's own carrier, size slot ignored | E4c (descend interior) |
| #22 `hKo` | `orderPhaseCost n ns W ≤ Ko j m`, size-blind in `m` | E-mem → order interior; E-order no-escape |
| #23 `hKc` | `coverPhaseCost n ns ≤ Kc j m`, size-blind, `112·n²` on its face | E3b |
| #27 `hKl` | the turn sum — the multiplier, and the slot that is *correct* | repair its summands |

`hKd` (#24) is **not** responsible (`sweepCost` is linear in `n`).

**Verdict: C0 is not reachable through the root as it stands.** The blocker is
the cost residue (E-mem → member-driven interiors → E-order re-run → E3b →
E4c → R1.8), not anything the B7 re-run can repair. S2 (finding 4's `"lw"`
repair) and S3 (`levelAtR`/`driverRootD`) remain worth landing and are the next
leaf; S5/G4 waits on the residue. G4 has **not** passed — JAN-FLAG 1 disposal
stays blocked.

**Correction, recorded.** `BridgeSeamProbe.width_lt_two_pow` does **not** close
finding 2, and the plan's "Arena width" section and the W3 commit message said
otherwise. `width_lt_two_pow` is a *space* statement bounding `W` by `2^w`; it
re-reads finding 2's width half and makes the `chainWidth ≤ W` pin
unaddressable. Finding 2 is a *cost* statement about `Kl`, and §D derives it
with `W` absent throughout. §E of the file compiles the two side by side
(`width_is_bounded` / `floor_has_no_width`) so the distinction is checkable.

Gates: `lake build` green at **3549 jobs**; `lax build --only proofs` OK;
kernel-three on every new declaration (`slot15_hQ` additionally on the one
endorsed Lax12 axiom, as `UqwInstantiation` does); `lean_verify` clean, no
source warnings; zero `sorry`/`admit`/`native_decide`. Four break tests run and
reverted, all biting: cubic `16 → 17` (2 errors), sharp `128 → 129` (1),
`deg_slot_at_starLast`'s `n → n+1` (1), and the plug's `hdeg` at `Kmass + 1`
(1 — so the plug is load-bearing on the identification of the word bound's
degree parameter with `hdeg`'s).

## Slot sweep (2026-08-02) — `Refine/SlotSweep.lean`, B7 S1

All 30 slots of `driverRoot_decides_sentence` checked for producers taking only
C0's own data. **24 clear, 6 block in three groups.**

**Group 1 — #6 `hcsr`.** Known. G1's repair lives in `DecodeImplementsD` at
`dedupNs/dedupOffset/dedupTarget`; the root still reads `CsrSimple` at
`2·edgeCount x / offset x / target x`. A producer exists the moment S3 lands.

**Group 2 — #26 `hdeg` and #12 `hB`. NEW, and it un-closes finding 3 at the
root.** The slot is quantified over **every** permutation. At `starLast n` —
the star with its centre ordered last — the centre weakly reaches the whole
vertex set at radius 1, so the slot forces `n ≤ Kmass`
(`deg_slot_at_starLast`), and no `Kmass` fixed before `n` satisfies it
(`slot26_hdeg_blocked`). Negative control `deg_slot_at_bot`: the same slot
holds at `Kmass = 1` on the edgeless graph, so it is the graph and not
`wreach`'s shape. Consequence is `ArenaWidth`'s own control 2 —
`WordBoundK B n Kmass ns cap mb` with `Kmass ≥ n` *is* the carrier bound
(`wordBound_of_deg_slot`), closing back to `n*n < 2^w`
(`no_word_size_through_deg_slot`). **W1–W3 are sound at the slot and not yet
usable at the root.** The producer with the right shape,
`exists_wreachDeg_of_orderP`, is restricted to `OrderP R` orderings, and
threading it is exactly S3.

**Group 3 — #20/#22/#23/#27. Finding 2 alive, and far sharper than
recorded.** `level_cost_floor_cubic`: from `hKs` and `hKl` **alone**, at
`ℓ ≥ 1`, `16·n³ ≤ Kl 0 n`. `W` occurs in neither hypothesis, nor the
conclusion, nor the proof — no `chainWidth`, no `hWc`, no `R`. **It was never
a width problem.** The mechanism is `descendCost`'s `16*(n*n)` inside
`turnCost`, paid by a turn processing an **empty block**
(`turnCostSize_size_blind`), times `hKl`'s `n` turns — the touched-only debt,
at `n³` rather than `n²`. With `hKo`+`hKc`: `128·n³`
(`level_cost_floor_sharp`).

*Residue work-list, by responsible slot:*

| slot | what is wrong | repair |
|---|---|---|
| #20 `hKs` | descent charged at carrier | E4c |
| #22 `hKo` | `orderPhaseCost` size-blind in `m` | E-mem / E-order |
| #23 `hKc` | `coverPhaseCost` size-blind, `112·n²` on its face | E3b |
| #27 `hKl` | the multiplier — **this slot is correct**; repair its summands | — |

`hKd` is **not** responsible (`sweepCost` is linear).

**Plug check.** `driverRoot_decides_sentence_floored` takes the root's
hypothesis list verbatim (plus `2 ≤ ℓ`) and returns the root's own unweakened
`Spec` **and** `128·n³ ≤ Kdec + (Kl 0 (n+ns) + Ksent)`. `hKmono` carries the
floor across E6's weight re-read. Over C0's budget at every `ε < 2`
(`#guard` at `ε = 1/2`, with an `ε = 3` control confirming it is the exponent
and not the constants).

**The supervisor's finding-2 correction is now compiled**, §E:
`width_is_bounded` (space — bounds `W` by `2^w`) beside `floor_has_no_width`
(cost — no `W` anywhere). The distinction is checkable rather than asserted.

**C0 is not reachable through the root as it stands.** Blocker is the cost
residue. S2 and S3 remain worth landing and are the next leaf. Gate G4 has not
passed, so JAN-FLAG 1 disposal stays blocked.

## S2/S3 (2026-08-06) — `Refine/DriverRootD.lean`: the restated root, and three brief-recipe corrections

The re-derivation road's first leaf. `lake build` **3,556 jobs**, root
`lax build` OK, zero placeholders, kernel-three; every landed plug check
(SlotSweep, BridgeCrossing, BridgeSeamProbe) untouched and green.
Supervisor replayed all gates.

**All four compiled kills landed.** (1) #6 `hcsr`: `slot06_dead_at_D` —
at the sweep's own witness word the landed triple's `CsrSimple` is
refuted while the composed-decode triple's holds; `driverRootD_decides_sentence`
has no `hcsr` slot at all (produced by `csrSimple_dedup` inside). (2)
#26 `hdeg`: `slot26_dead_at_R` — `∃ Kmass` (= 3) **before** the instance
satisfying the `OrderP`-conditional slot on the whole `starLast` family;
mechanism compiled (`OrderP 0` forces back-degree 1 on a sub-star, wreach
≤ 3); negative control: the sweep's refuting tuple carries no `OrderP`
for `n ≥ 3` — the guard does the work. (3) #12 `hB`:
`slot12_hB_nondegenerate` — at `Kmass = ⌈c·n^δ⌉₊`, `δ < 1`, the
degeneration hypothesis `n ≤ Kmass` fails for all large `n`. (4) Finding
4: `restated_pre_initEnv_where_landed_is_not` — at `0 < ns` the restated
precondition is `initEnv`-satisfiable while the landed one is not, the
exact converse of `rootPre_initEnv_iff_ns_zero`.

**Slot diff from the landed root** (R = 0 form, fully discharged from
landed capital): precondition `OrderMem` index `ns → 0` plus `DedupMem`;
died — `hcsr`, `hO`, `hT`, `hpad0` (the data triple is
`dedupNs/dedupOffset/dedupTarget` definitionally); changed — `hKdec`
covers `decodeCost + dedupCost + 4`, cost reads `Kl 0 (n + dedupNs x)`;
new — `hnsW : ns ≤ W` (the landed root read it off `OrderMem ns`, which
no longer carries it); all remaining slots byte-identical in shape and
order. The general-`R` sibling `driverRootD_decides_sentenceR` consumes
`levelAtR`; `hdeg` is gone there — degree enters through the ordering
slot's value.

**Three supervisor-brief recipes were wrong, each corrected compiled —
they route the next waves.** (1) "decodeImplementsD ∘ lwCom_spec" does
not typecheck: both landed decode Specs demand `OrderMem ns` *before*
the decode; the worker replayed the landed walk once at index 0
(`decode_spec_lw0`) and composed `decodeCom ; lwCom ; dedupCom`
(`decodeImplementsDL`). (2) `P := OrderP R G M` cannot inhabit
`levelImplements`'s ordering slot — the frozen induction binds `P`
before the mask `OrderP` names; the admissible value is the mask-uniform
`DegOrder n G cap Kmass`, which is what `levelAtR` uses; and the RL
width-guard bridge from bare `LevelPre` is vacuous
(`ns_lt_chainWidthE`/`no_guard_instance` compiled beside the bridge).
Closing either properly is a **landed-file wave: thread `P π ord` and
the width guard through the cluster interface.** (3) General-`R`
residuals: `RamDriverWrites` exists at `R = 0` only; `hptr`/`hexit` get
`OrdersBy` alone. `levelAtR` carries three named residual hypothesis
groups (`horder` at `DegOrder`, `hfr : RFrames` with `R = 0` plug
`rFrames_zero`, `hptr`/`hexit`), each a theorem-shaped gap with its
producer path documented in the file.

**Road position.** Slots #6/#26/#12 and finding 4 are dead at the
restated root; the remaining blockers are exactly the cost group —
which the re-derivation (P4.6 verdict) replaces — plus the named
residuals above. Next: the member-driven engine family (2E/D-a in
member form), then `g2_exists` re-validation, then E-mem; the
cluster-interface threading wave slots where the re-derivation
re-states that interface anyway.

## g2_exists re-validation (2026-08-06) — `Refine/G2ExistsRevalidation.lean`: the arithmetic holds at M-class costs

Item 4 of "What remains before C0", run ahead of the engine family per
the standing compiled-costs-both-directions rule. `lake build` **3,560
jobs**, root `lax build` OK, zero placeholders, eight kernel-three
checks; supervisor replayed. **Verdict: the existence witness is
satisfiable at M-class phase costs; nothing weakened.**

- `phaseM a b m = a·m + b` tied to P4.6's measurement by `rfl`
  (`phaseClockK_eq_phaseM`); `g2m_exists` pays each phase slot at every
  member count the weight admits and delivers the landed Σ-interface
  shapes verbatim, closing to `(ℓ·g2M + Cb)·(D+1)^ℓ·(w+1)`.
- C0 budget gates at the 68/12 numerals clear ε = 1 and ε = 1/2; an
  `R = 4` gate also clears — the round factor multiplies a constant, not
  the carrier.
- Space: `mclass_driver_fits` consumes E41's `nested_fits_iff`;
  `levels·aw` linear stays a separate named obligation.
- **Negative control bites both ways**: with exactly one slot at the
  landed size-blind `orderPhaseCost`, the same three-clause family is
  satisfiable-without and **unsatisfiable-with** the closed form
  (`mclass_order_slot_load_bearing`, `decide +kernel`, `W` universal).
- Root term closes at the restated root's own cost text
  (`rootBudgetM_closes`); `decodeDLCost ≤ 79·(n+ns+1)`, 79 tight.

Two road facts: the surviving obstruction in the mixed control is the
`1600·n²` **carrier** term alone (the width half is already dead at
`width_step_dead`) — the re-derivation's target is the carrier walk,
not allocation width; and the scatter leaf has no measured M-class
constant yet (`atomCostA` landed but unwired — `hbnd_gap`), so the
engine family should produce one. **Next: the member-driven engine
family (elim first).**

## E-elim.1 (2026-08-06) — `Refine/ElimSynth7.lean`: the engine is one Com, and the leaf's entry state is free

Tower-ledger E43 obstructions (2) and (3) die. `lake build` **3,565
jobs**, root `lax build` OK, zero placeholders, kernel-three on all five
principals; supervisor replayed. Jan stopped and resumed the worker
mid-wave (the `twiceElim` unfolding fix); first report after resume ends
the wave.

- **2B/D-a closed on the way**: `degPassSynth` — the degree pass's outer
  loop, recorded since 2B′ as "one invocation away" — synthesizes
  post-T1 (~15 s), pinned with a negative control.
- **`elimEngineCom`** (comSize 333): the five passes as one `Com`, ONE
  `hnRefine` against `ElimSynth6.elimProgram`'s exact NRest text,
  composed by `hnr_seq` + a new guard-carrying `hnr_map` — never a
  whole-engine re-synthesis, so wave S's determinism cliff never fires.
  Offset/fill re-synthesized at fresh index cells (the landed `"i"`
  exits the bucket pass at `n`; no abstract op pays a reset).
- **`hnr_mop_elim_spec`**: abstract program literally
  `NRest.spec (ElimPost n W) …` — no entry-state tuple. Six pure-scratch
  arrays enter AND leave as `junkArrayOfLen`; the five output arrays'
  length premises are exactly `ElimPost`'s clauses, discharged at call 2
  from call 1. **The semantic finding: entry freedom REQUIRES the
  scratch-building inside the `Com`** — a spec leaf over the bare five
  passes would be unsound — so `elimSpecK = 384n + 168ns + 126` honestly
  exceeds `engineK5` by the leaf's own setup (`#guard`-pinned, incl.
  `¬ ≤` and `≤ 2·engineK5`). This is "how the re-zeroing defect dies"
  made machine-real: the engine produces the zeros its loops enter at;
  `elimRezeroCom` has no counterpart because nothing outside the engine
  needs re-zeroing.
- **Twice-call test LANDED**: `twiceElimSynth` synthesizes the two-call
  shape through the new leaf, impl `#guard`-pinned as the same `Com`
  twice; negative control compiles the pinned `hnr_mop_elim`'s refusal
  on the identical shape.
- Reusable kit (own namespace): `hnr_map`, `hnRefine_frame_fri` (frame
  via `fri`'s FRAME mode — what made 5-seam hand composition cheap),
  `hnr_scr1–5`, `returnT_le_spec_iff`.

Carried, named: a pass-13-shaped matcher stall after the two calls
(parked for the member wave, `sepref_dbg` tracing); the leaf pins
`off/tgt/alv` at `arrOf` values (same class as split-determinism;
member wave); debts E1/E2/E3 untouched. **Next: E-mem** — member lists
into `LevelPre` (successor-brief item (1)), then the member-driven
engine interiors consume this leaf's assembly.

## E-mem-design (2026-08-06) — `e-mem-design.md` + `Refine/MemThreadProbe.lean`: the clause is existential, and the blast radius collapses

The road's last design gate, G2-design style: no frozen-surface edits,
accounting compiled both directions. `lake build` **3,566 jobs**, root
`lax build` OK, zero placeholders, kernel-three on all seven principals;
supervisor replayed.

**Settled**: `LevelPre` gains ONE appended existential clause —
`∃ Mem mmj, arrs (memName j) = arrOf n Mem ∧ vars (mnumName j) = mmj ∧
MemList n mmj Mem (markSet n M) ∧ word bound` — names on the
`cps`/`alv` precedent, fixed length `n` + count scalar (E29-inherits
the allocation story). **The `∃`-packaging is lossless by compiled
uniqueness** (`memList_unique`) and leaves `LevelPre`'s signature
unchanged, collapsing the 17-file radius to destructuring repairs + two
frame side conditions. No tail-content conjunct (n = 0 control, the
F-c-4 lesson). `DepthMem` gains one `Sized` entry.

**Compiled**: existence at root and child shapes; producer add-on on
the `clusterLoad` shape `8·bs+2` + filter `21·bs+8`, carrier-blind
pinned; mask-only build `Ω(n)` (OrderBlockProbe's prose claim now a
guard); `unsorted_emission_refuted` (BFS-order emission kills
`smono`); consumer wiring at clock 66 both carriers; floor-death —
`memPhase_escapes_floor` at the arena weight where the landed text is
refuted, and `memPhase_interface_closes` = `g2m_exists` instantiated,
cited not re-derived.

**Thread decomposition** (doc §6): T1 spine owner (names + clause +
`levelPre_run` + `descendCom` text + stale 13-clause docstring), T2
producer walks (`clusterLoad_spec`/`CluScan`, `DescendStep` export,
root list), T3 destructuring satellites (pinned list; IO:817 is a
silent-absorb site), T4 frame sweep (~16 files), T5 consumer re-wire
explicitly OUT (the re-synthesis openings). `ElimSynth7`'s `arrOf` pin
carried until E2. **Four flags open** (doc §7, deliberately): F-1
sortedness under E3's discovery-order emit, F-2 `ArenaA` length seam,
F-3 root-list placement vs G1, F-4 `BatchData` vs bare-∃ export —
supervisor dispositions at the T1 briefing, not silently in the thread.
**Next: T1, single owner, after flag dispositions.**
