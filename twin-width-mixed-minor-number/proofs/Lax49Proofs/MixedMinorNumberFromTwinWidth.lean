# The twin-width-to-mixed direction

The source development bounds the source mixed minor number linearly in
source twin-width; `Lax49Proofs.Bridge` proves both submitted parameters
pointwise equal to their source counterparts, so the bound transports
verbatim.

conclusion: Lax49.MixedMinorNumberFromTwinWidth.exists_mixedMinorNumber_bound_of_twinWidth
---
The submitted mixed minor number is bounded by a numerical function of
twin-width (the parameter of submission Lax48); the witness is the linear
function `d ↦ 2 * (d + 3) + 2`.

# Proof strategy

The left-to-right leaf order of a twin-decomposition of width `twinWidth G`
makes the ordered adjacency matrix twin-ordered, and the first item of the
grid-minor theorem for twin-width bounds the mixed number of a twin-ordered
matrix linearly; the `+3` absorbs the diagonal convention and the two
one-sided child zones created by mirroring a graph contraction as a row and
a column fusion. Rewriting with the two parameter equalities of
`Lax49Proofs.Bridge` moves the bound onto the submitted parameters.
