# The mixed-minor-to-twin-width direction

The source development bounds source twin-width by a function of the source
mixed minor number; `Lax49Proofs.Bridge` proves both submitted parameters
pointwise equal to their source counterparts, so the bound transports
verbatim.

conclusion: Lax49.TwinWidthFromMixedMinorNumber.exists_twinWidth_bound_of_mixedMinorNumber
---
Twin-width (the parameter of submission Lax48) is bounded by a numerical
function of the submitted mixed minor number.

# Proof strategy

The source direction `twinWidthBoundedByMixedMinorNumber` is the mirrored
Boolean Theorem 14 construction: an ordered adjacency matrix of mixed number
`k` is `(k+1)`-mixed-free, and the Marcus–Tardos-based Theorem 10 machinery
turns a mixed-free matrix into a contraction sequence of bounded red degree.
Rewriting with the two parameter equalities of `Lax49Proofs.Bridge` moves the
bound onto the submitted parameters, with the same witness function.
